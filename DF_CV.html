        <h3>Distance Functions</h3>
    </section>


<section>
  <h4> Introduction</h4>
  <p>In computer vision, especially in the context of binary image analysis and object recognition, understanding the spatial relationship between pixels is often crucial. One way to quantify this spatial relationship is by using distance functions. A distance function is a mathematical tool that measures the distance between two points or objects in an image. It plays a critical role in morphological operations, shape analysis, image segmentation, skeletonization, and feature extraction.</p>
  <p>Unlike simple pixel intensity comparisons, distance functions enable computers to perceive how far apart objects are, how close a pixel is to the edge of a shape, or how centered a point is within a region. This geometric insight makes distance functions essential for intelligent visual reasoning.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4> How It Works</h4>
  <p>A distance function operates by computing a distance metric between a given point (or pixel) and other points, based on predefined mathematical rules. In a binary image, the function is typically applied to the foreground pixels (object pixels) and calculates their distance from the nearest background pixel, or vice versa.</p>
  <p>The most common procedure used is called the Distance Transform, which converts a binary image into a grayscale image where each pixel’s value represents the distance to the nearest zero (background) pixel.</p>

  <h5> Steps of Distance Transform:</h5>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Input</strong>: A binary image with foreground and background pixels.</li>
    <li><strong>Labeling</strong>: Identify all background pixels (usually 0) and mark foreground pixels (usually 1).</li>
    <li><strong>Transformation</strong>: For each foreground pixel, calculate the distance to the nearest background pixel using a distance metric.</li>
    <li><strong>Output</strong>: A grayscale image where brighter pixels indicate larger distances from the background.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

  <h4> Common Distance Metrics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5>Euclidean Distance (L2 Norm)</h5>
      <p><code>D = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)</code></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gives the straight-line distance between two points.</li>
        <li>Most accurate and isotropic but computationally expensive.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm)</h5>
      <p><code>D = |x₂ - x₁| + |y₂ - y₁|</code></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Measures the distance along axes like moving on a grid.</li>
        <li>Faster to compute, but less natural for curved shapes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Chessboard Distance (L∞ Norm)</h5>
      <p><code>D = max(|x₂ - x₁|, |y₂ - y₁|)</code></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Measures the number of moves a king would take in chess.</li>
        <li>Useful for block-based or morphological operations.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>City Block Distance</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Special case of Manhattan Distance.</li>
        <li>Often used in discrete grid-based images.</li>
        <li>Approximates real-world travel distances in urban layouts.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4> Key Features and Characteristics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Transforms binary to grayscale: Distance functions create a continuous representation of object proximity.</li>
    <li>Helps identify skeletons: Pixels furthest from the edge form the "centerline" of objects.</li>
    <li>Enhances object separation: Useful in separating touching or overlapping objects.</li>
    <li>Supports morphological operations: Distance functions are integral to advanced dilation, erosion, and segmentation tasks.</li>
    <li>Geometric insight: Adds a spatial dimension to shape analysis beyond simple pixel comparisons.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Sensitivity to noise: Small artifacts can affect distance maps unless preprocessed</li>

  <h4> Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Distance functions bring a geometric and mathematical perspective to computer vision. They enable machines to go beyond simple pixel comparison and truly understand how far objects or features are from one another. By using various distance metrics and transforms, we can compute useful features like object thickness, spacing, centrality, and shape.</p>
  <p>Whether for measuring tumor sizes in medical scans, creating skeletal models of handwritten characters, or enhancing object segmentation in noisy environments, distance functions remain a powerful, essential component in the toolbox of any vision system. Their ability to blend math, geometry, and image processing makes them invaluable for building intelligent, spatially aware applications.</p>
