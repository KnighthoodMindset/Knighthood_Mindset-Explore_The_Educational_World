  <h3>Programming on Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are two of the most widely used public cloud platforms. They offer a variety of services like computing, storage, databases, machine learning, and more.</p>
  <p>Programming on these platforms means building, deploying, and managing cloud-based applications using the tools, SDKs, and services provided by AWS and Azure.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Programming on Amazon AWS</h4>
  <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a wide range of tools and SDKs for developers to write and run cloud-based applications.

</p>
  <h5>Programming Tools and Services in AWS</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>AWS Management Console – Web-based UI to access and manage AWS services.</li>
    <li>AWS CLI – Command-line interface to manage services via commands.</li>
    <li>AWS SDKs for Java, Python (boto3), JavaScript (Node.js), .NET, PHP.</li>
    <li>AWS Lambda – Serverless computing service.</li>
    <li>Amazon EC2 – Virtual servers in the cloud.</li>
    <li>Amazon S3 – Object storage service.</li>
    <li>AWS CloudFormation – Infrastructure as code.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Example Use Case</h5>
  <p>A developer can use Python with boto3 SDK to create an S3 bucket, upload files, and trigger AWS Lambda functions automatically.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Programming on Microsoft Azure</h4>
  <p>Microsoft Azure also provides a rich set of cloud tools, APIs, and SDKs for developers to build, test, and deploy applications.</p>
  <h5>Programming Tools and Services in Azure</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Azure Portal – Web interface to manage Azure services.</li>
    <li>Azure CLI – Command-line tool for interacting with Azure.</li>
    <li>Azure SDKs for .NET, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go.</li>
    <li>Azure Functions – Serverless compute service.</li>
    <li>Azure Virtual Machines – Cloud-based virtual servers.</li>
    <li>Azure Blob Storage – For storing large unstructured data.</li>
    <li>Azure Resource Manager (ARM) – Infrastructure as code tool.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Example Use Case</h5>
  <p>A developer can use C# with Azure SDK to upload images to Azure Blob Storage and trigger Azure Functions for processing.</p>

  <h4>Advantages of Programming on Cloud Platforms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Scalability – Easily scale your code.</li>
    <li>Pay-as-you-go – No hardware investment.</li>
    <li>Global Deployment – Apps can be deployed worldwide.</li>
    <li>Integration – Easy connection with databases and AI tools.</li>
    <li>Security – Built-in access control and encryption.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Challenges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Learning Curve – Requires time to learn tools and services.</li>
    <li>Costs – Can become expensive if not managed.</li>
    <li>Vendor Lock-in – May become dependent on a specific cloud provider.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Programming on AWS and Azure gives developers powerful tools to build and deploy scalable, reliable, and cost-effective applications. Both platforms offer a wide range of programming SDKs, serverless options, storage, and computing services. Choosing between them depends on project needs, preferred programming languages, and integrations. Developers benefit from learning both to stay flexible in the cloud ecosystem.
