    <h3>Syntax-Directed Translation Schemes</h3>
    <p>A Syntax-Directed Translation Scheme (SDT Scheme) is a formal mechanism for specifying how semantic rules or actions can be interleaved with grammar productions to perform translation during parsing. Unlike syntax-directed definitions (SDDs), where semantic actions are associated with attributes, SDT schemes allow embedding actual semantic actions directly within the right-hand side of production rules.</p>

    <p>In essence, SDT Schemes combine context-free grammars with executable actions, helping compilers to translate source code into intermediate code, perform semantic checks, or build abstract syntax trees — as part of the parsing process.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h4>Key Goals of SDT Schemes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Attach meaning to syntactic structures.</li>
        <li>Integrate parsing and translation into one process.</li>
        <li>Perform semantic actions such as code generation, symbol table handling, type checking, etc.</li>
        <li>Allow inline execution of translation actions during parsing.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h4>Components of an SDT Scheme</h4>
    <p>An SDT Scheme includes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Grammar rules (productions) of a context-free grammar.</li>
        <li>Embedded semantic actions written in a programming language (usually inside curly braces <code>{}</code>).</li>
        <li>A parsing method to execute the embedded actions in the correct order (top-down or bottom-up parsing).</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section>
    <h4>Example of SDT Scheme</h4>
    <p>Let’s take a grammar for arithmetic expressions:</p>
    <pre>
E → E + T { print('+'); }
E → T
T → T * F { print('*'); }
T → F
F → (E)
F → id { print(id.name); }
    </pre>
    <p>The <code>{ print(...) }</code> parts are semantic actions executed during parsing to generate postfix notation.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h4>Types of SDT Schemes</h4>

    <h5>1. Postfix SDT (Bottom-Up Parsing Based)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>All actions are placed at the end of the production.</li>
        <li>Actions are executed after all the grammar symbols on the right-hand side have been recognized.</li>
        <li>Suitable for bottom-up parsing, especially LR parsing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <pre>E → E T + { print('+'); }</pre>

    <h5>2. General SDT (Top-Down or Mixed)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Actions may appear anywhere in the production.</li>
        <li>Suitable for top-down parsers like recursive descent parsers.</li>
        <li>Requires careful ordering of actions to maintain consistency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <pre>E → { action1(); } T { action2(); } + E</pre>
</section>

    <h4>How SDT Schemes Work During Parsing</h4>

    <h5>Top-Down Parsing</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Traverse the parse tree from root to leaves.</li>
        <li>Execute actions in the order they appear in the production.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Bottom-Up Parsing</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Build the tree from leaves to root.</li>
        <li>Execute actions when a production is reduced.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Modularity: Embeds semantics in grammar in a clean and structured way.</li>
        <li>Efficiency: Enables translation while parsing, saving extra passes.</li>
        <li>Flexibility: Supports many types of language features and translation requirements.</li>
        <li>Compiler Automation: Used by tools like YACC and Bison for automatic parser generation.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h4>Limitations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Action Placement Matters: Incorrect ordering of actions may produce wrong translations.</li>
        <li>Error-Prone in Complex Grammars: Complex SDTs are hard to debug and maintain.</li>
        <li>Limited to Parsing Strategy: Not all SDT schemes are compatible with both top-down and bottom-up parsing.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Syntax-Directed Translation Schemes are a powerful tool in compiler construction. They allow us to specify what actions should be taken when a specific grammar rule is applied. By combining parsing and translation into a unified framework, SDT schemes help simplify the compiler’s design while enabling features like syntax tree construction, intermediate code generation, and semantic analysis.</p>

    <p>Whether you are building a basic calculator or a full compiler, SDT schemes form the backbone of meaningful translation in syntax analysis.</p>
