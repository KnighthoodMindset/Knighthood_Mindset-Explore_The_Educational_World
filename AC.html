        <h3>Activation Records</h3>
        <p>    An Activation Record, also known as a stack frame, is a data structure that stores information about a single execution of a procedure or function. Whenever a function is called, a new activation record is pushed onto the call stack, and when the function returns, the activation record is popped off the stack.
        <br>    This mechanism is crucial for run-time support in programming languages that allow recursion, nested function calls, and parameter passing.
        </p>

        <h4>Structure of an Activation Record</h4>
        <p>    A typical activation record contains several fields:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>    Return Address
        </strong>
            <ul><li>    This stores the address of the instruction to which control should return after the function execution is completed.
            </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>    Actual Parameters (Arguments)
        </strong>
    <ul><li>    These are the values passed from the caller to the callee function.
    </li></ul></li>
    <li><strong>    Control Link
    </strong><ul><li>    A pointer to the activation record of the caller function. This helps the control return to the correct context.
    </li></ul></li>
    <li><strong>    Access Link (optional)
    </strong><ul><li>    Points to the activation record of the enclosing (lexically outer) function in languages with nested scopes (like Pascal or inner functions in JavaScript).
    </li></ul></li>
    <li><strong>    Saved Machine Status
    </strong><ul><li>    Stores temporary information like register values, flags, etc., which need to be restored after the function call returns.
    </li></ul></li>
    <li><strong>    Local Variables
    </strong><ul><li>    Holds space for the local variables defined within the function.
    </li></ul></li>
    <li><strong>    Temporaries
    </strong><ul><li>    Stores intermediate results of expressions computed during function execution.
    </li></ul></li>
         </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Layout of an Activation Record</h4>
        <table>
            <td>Temporaries</td>
            <td>Local Variables  </td>
            <td>Saved Machine Status</td>
            <td>Access Link (opt)</td>
            <td>Control Link   </td>
            <td>Actual Parameters</td>
            <td>Return Address </td>
            
        </table>
        <p>    Each new function call creates a new activation record, and it is placed on top of the runtime stack.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Activation Record and Recursion</h4>
        <p>    For example:<br>
            <pre>int factorial(int n) {
                if (n == 0) return 1;
                return n * factorial(n - 1);
            }</pre><br>    Each call to factorial(n) has a separate activation record with its own n and return value, enabling proper computation without interfering with other calls.
    
        </p>
      </section>

        <h4>Role in Compiler Design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> Supports Function Calls:</strong>    Activation records help manage the flow of control and data during function invocations.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Handles Nested Scopes:</strong>     Using access links, compilers can implement lexical scoping rules efficiently.
            </li>
            <li><strong> Stack-Based Execution Model:</strong>    Most compilers generate stack-based code where activation records are manipulated using push/pop operations.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
       <section>
        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>    Memory Allocation for Procedures
            </li>
            <li>    Support for Recursion
            </li>
            <li>    Access to Non-local Variables in Nested Functions
            </li>
            <li>    Backtracking and State Restoration
            </li>
        </ol>
       </section>
       <section>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>    An Activation Record is essential for managing function calls, especially in languages that support recursion, parameters, and local variables. By storing the return address, parameters, control information, and local data, it provides the runtime environment with the context needed to execute functions correctly and efficiently.
    <br>      Understanding activation records is fundamental to understanding procedure calls, recursion handling, and memory management in compiler design.
