    <h3>Human and Computer-Based Social Engineering Techniques</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <p>Social Engineering is a psychological manipulation technique used by attackers to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Instead of breaking through a firewall or exploiting software vulnerabilities, social engineers exploit human behavior such as trust, fear, urgency, curiosity, or greed.</p>
    <p>These attacks are categorized broadly into:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Human-Based Social Engineering Techniques</li>
      <li>Computer-Based Social Engineering Techniques</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both types aim to bypass technical defenses by attacking the weakest link in the security chain — the human.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>2. Importance in Ethical Hacking</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Simulate real-world attack scenarios during penetration testing.</li>
      <li>Train organizations in detecting and mitigating manipulation.</li>
      <li>Raise awareness about common deceptive techniques.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding both human and computer-based techniques is crucial to prevent identity theft, phishing, data breaches, and insider threats.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>3. Human-Based Social Engineering Techniques</h4>
    <p>These involve direct interaction between the attacker and the victim, where the attacker manipulates the victim using psychological strategies.</p>

    <h5>3.1 Impersonation</h5>
    <p>The attacker pretends to be someone trustworthy — like an IT technician, government official, or co-worker — to extract confidential information.</p>
    <blockquote>Example: An attacker pretending to be tech support asking for login credentials.</blockquote>

    <h5>3.2 Tailgating (Piggybacking)</h5>
    <p>The attacker physically follows an authorized person into a restricted area without providing credentials.</p>
    <blockquote>Example: Someone holding a coffee cup and pretending to forget their access card, asking you to hold the door.</blockquote>

    <h5>3.3 Shoulder Surfing</h5>
    <p>Observing a user typing passwords or PINs by looking over their shoulder or using hidden cameras.</p>
    <p>Common in: ATMs, internet cafés, or office desks.</p>

    <h5>3.4 Eavesdropping</h5>
    <p>Listening to private conversations to gather sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or project details.</p>

    <h5>3.5 Pretexting</h5>
    <p>The attacker creates a fabricated scenario (pretext) to steal information or gain access.</p>
    <blockquote>Example: Calling an employee pretending to be an auditor requesting employee records.</blockquote>

    <h5>3.6 Dumpster Diving</h5>
    <p>The attacker searches through physical trash bins to find sensitive documents like old passwords, confidential reports, or bills.</p>

    <h5>3.7 Baiting</h5>
    <p>Leaving a physical device (e.g., USB drive labeled "Salary Report 2025") in a visible place, expecting someone to plug it in and install malware.</p>

    <h5>3.8 Quid Pro Quo</h5>
    <p>The attacker offers something valuable (like technical support or free software) in exchange for confidential information.</p>

    <h4>4. Computer-Based Social Engineering Techniques</h4>
    <p>These techniques involve the use of software, websites, or digital platforms to manipulate users into compromising security.</p>

    <h5>4.1 Phishing</h5>
    <p>A fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information via fake emails, websites, or messages that appear to come from legitimate sources.</p>
    <blockquote>Example: A fake email from your bank asking you to verify your account by clicking a malicious link.</blockquote>

    <h5>4.2 Spear Phishing</h5>
    <p>A targeted phishing attack aimed at a specific individual or organization, usually with personalized content.</p>
    <blockquote>Example: An email addressing you by name and mentioning your workplace to gain credibility.</blockquote>

    <h5>4.3 Whaling</h5>
    <p>Spear phishing directed specifically at high-profile targets like CEOs, CFOs, or board members.</p>
    <p>Goal: Gain access to corporate secrets or authorize financial transfers.</p>

    <h5>4.4 Vishing (Voice Phishing)</h5>
    <p>Using phone calls to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive data, like banking credentials or verification codes.</p>
    <blockquote>Example: Automated voice calls warning of suspicious account activity.</blockquote>

    <h5>4.5 Smishing (SMS Phishing)</h5>
    <p>Sending malicious links or misleading messages via SMS to trick users into clicking on them.</p>

    <h5>4.6 Fake Software Updates</h5>
    <p>Creating pop-ups or websites that imitate software update notifications, tricking users into installing malware.</p>

    <h5>4.7 Rogue Security Software</h5>
    <p>Convincing users their system is infected and offering fake antivirus software that is actually malware.</p>

    <h5>4.8 Malicious Advertisements (Malvertising)</h5>
    <p>Embedding malware into ads on legitimate websites. Clicking on the ad may download a trojan or redirect to phishing sites.</p>

    <h4>7. Role of Ethical Hackers</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Test organizational preparedness.</li>
      <li>Educate staff on identifying and reporting such attempts.</li>
      <li>Evaluate physical and digital security.</li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>8. Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Both human and computer-based social engineering techniques are powerful tools in a hacker's arsenal, exploiting human psychology more than system flaws. The line between these two is increasingly blurred as attackers blend them for advanced threats.</p>
    <blockquote>"Security is not just about systems; it's about people. And people must be trained, tested, and trusted."</blockquote>
    <p>Combating these attacks requires a multi-layered approach combining technology, awareness, policy enforcement, and ethical testing.</p>
