        <h3>Radio Frequency Identification</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless, non-contact technology that uses radio waves to identify and track objects equipped with RFID tags. It is a crucial enabling technology for IoT (Internet of Things), providing automatic identification, real-time tracking, and data collection capabilities across a wide range of industries. Unlike traditional barcode systems, which require line-of-sight and manual scanning, RFID systems can automatically read tags at varying distances, even when the tagged items are moving or hidden.</p>
      <p>RFID systems consist of three primary components: an RFID tag, an RFID reader, and a backend database system. This technology helps bridge the gap between the physical world and digital systems by uniquely identifying everyday items—such as inventory, assets, vehicles, or even people—thus allowing seamless integration and automation in IoT ecosystems.</p>

      <h4>Key Features of RFID</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Wireless Identification: </strong>Uses radio waves to identify tagged objects automatically.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Non-Contact Communication: </strong>Tags can be read without direct line-of-sight, even through packaging or surfaces.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Unique Identification: </strong>Each RFID tag contains a unique identifier, ensuring traceability and precision.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Multiple Tag Reading: </strong>Capable of reading several tags simultaneously, improving efficiency in bulk tracking.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Various Ranges: </strong>Tags are available in low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF), and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) variants, each with different read ranges and uses.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Reusable Tags: </strong>Many RFID tags are durable and can be reused for long-term asset tracking.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>How it works</h4>
      <p>The functioning of an RFID system is based on radio wave communication between a tag and a reader. The RFID tag, which is embedded with a microchip and an antenna, stores data such as a unique serial number or product information. The RFID reader emits radio signals through its own antenna, which powers the tag (in the case of passive tags) and communicates with it by transmitting and receiving radio waves.</p>
      <p>When a tag comes into the reader’s range, it gets activated and transmits its stored information back to the reader. The reader then captures this data and sends it to a backend system or database for processing, logging, or real-time action. For instance, in a warehouse setting, as boxes with RFID tags pass through a gate, the reader automatically records each item without manual scanning.</p>
      <p>There are three types of RFID tags: </p>
      <li>Passive Tags – no internal battery; powered by reader signals.</li>
      <li>Active Tags – powered by an internal battery; offer longer range.</li>
      <li>Semi-Passive Tags – battery-powered, but only for the circuitry (not for communication).</li>
      <p>The seamless nature of RFID systems allows them to operate in environments where speed, automation, and accuracy are critical.</p>

      <h4>Importance of RFID in IoT</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Automatic Identification: </strong>Eliminates manual data entry by identifying objects in real time.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Real-Time Visibility: </strong>Enables constant monitoring and tracking of assets, people, or inventory.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Foundation for Smart Systems: </strong>Acts as a key input mechanism in IoT systems for location, identity, and status data.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Improved Operational Efficiency: </strong>Streamlines supply chain, inventory management, and logistics processes.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Supports Data-Driven Decision Making: </strong>Helps businesses make informed decisions with accurate, real-time data.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Security and Access Control: </strong>Plays a role in identity verification and restricted area access.</p>

      <h4>Characteristics</h4>
      <li>Tag-Based System – Requires the use of RFID tags attached to items.</li>
      <li>Contactless Technology – Operates without physical contact or direct scanning.</li>
      <li>Fast and Efficient – Capable of reading thousands of tags per second.</li>
      <li>Durability – Tags can withstand harsh environments (e.g., heat, water, chemicals).</li>
      <li>Customizable Range – Can operate in short-range or long-range depending on frequency.</li>

      <h4>Advantages of RFID</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Automation: </strong>Reduces human effort by enabling automatic identification and tracking.</p>
      <p><strong>2. High Speed: </strong>Reads multiple tags in seconds, speeding up processing in retail, logistics, and warehouses.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Versatile Use: </strong>Can be embedded in various materials—plastic cards, clothes, metal, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Data Capacity: </strong>Tags can store more information than barcodes.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Security Features: </strong>Some RFID systems support encryption and password protection.</p>
      <p><strong>6. No Line-of-Sight Required: </strong>Enhances flexibility and reduces the need for precise tag placement.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Complex Infrastructure: </strong>Requires integration with backend systems, readers, and antennae.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Tag Collision: </strong>Reading too many tags at once may cause interference, though anti-collision algorithms exist.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Battery Dependency (Active Tags): </strong>Active tags require maintenance and battery replacement.</p>
