      <h3>Parse Trees</h3>
   </section>
   <section>
      <p>A parse tree (also known as a syntax tree) is a hierarchical, tree-like structure that represents the syntactic structure of a string in a formal language, according to a given context-free grammar (CFG). In other words, it illustrates how a sequence of tokens derived from source code can be parsed or generated by the grammar of the programming language.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h4>Key Elements of a Parse Tree</h4>
      <h5>1. Root</h5>
      <p>The root of the parse tree corresponds to the start symbol of the grammar (usually denoted as <strong>S</strong> or <strong>E</strong>).</p>
      <p>All derivations begin from this root.</p>
      <h5>2. Non-Terminal Nodes</h5>
      <p>Internal nodes (not leaves) in the parse tree represent non-terminal symbols from the grammar. Non-terminals are symbols that can be replaced or expanded according to the grammar rules.</p>
      <h5>3. Terminal Nodes</h5>
      <p>The leaves (bottom nodes) of the parse tree are terminal symbols, which represent the actual symbols from the language. These include keywords, operators, literals, identifiers, and other basic elements.</p>
      <h5>4. Edges</h5>
      <p>Edges represent the application of production rules from the grammar. They connect a non-terminal node to its child nodes, which could be either non-terminal or terminal symbols.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h4>Structure of a Parse Tree</h4>
      <p>Consider the following context-free grammar for simple arithmetic expressions:</p>
      <p>E → E + T | T</p>
      <p>T → T * F | F</p>
      <p>F → (E) | id</p>
      <p>For the expression `id + id * id`, the parse tree would look like this:</p>
      <pre>
              E
            /   \
           E     +
          / \     \
         T   T     *
        / \  / \   \
        F  F F  F   id
        |   | |  |
       id  id id  id
      </pre>
      <p>Here:</p>
      <li><strong>E</strong> is the Start Symbol</li>
      <li>The internal nodes are non-terminals (<strong>E</strong>, <strong>T</strong>, <strong>F</strong>).</li>
      <li>The leaves (terminal nodes) represent the actual symbols: `id`, `+`, `*`.</li>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h4>Constructing Parse Trees</h4>
      <p>The construction of a parse tree involves repeatedly applying the production rules of the grammar to expand non-terminal symbols until a valid sequence of terminal symbols is formed.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Start with the Start Symbol: </strong>Begin with the start symbol of the grammar (e.g., <strong>E</strong>).</p>
      <p><strong>2. Apply Production Rules: </strong>Use the grammar's production rules to replace the non-terminal with the corresponding right-hand side of the rule. Each time a production rule is applied, an internal node is created.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Continue Expanding Non-Terminals: </strong>Continue expanding non-terminal symbols until all nodes in the tree are terminal symbols.</p>
      <p><strong>4. End with Terminal Symbols: </strong>Once all non-terminals are expanded into terminals, the tree reaches its leaf nodes, and the parse tree is complete.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h4>Types of Parse Trees</h4>
      <p>There are two main ways to derive the parse tree:</p>
      <h5>1. Leftmost Derivation</h5>
      <li>This method involves expanding the leftmost non-terminal first at each step.</li>
      <li>This approach corresponds to a top-down parser.</li>
      <h5>2. Rightmost Derivation</h5>
      <li>This method involves expanding the rightmost non-terminal first at each step.</li>
      <li>This approach corresponds to a bottom-up parser.</li>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h4>Importance of Parse Trees</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Syntax Validation: </strong>A parse tree confirms that a given string of tokens follows the grammar rules of the language. If the tree can be built successfully, the program is syntactically valid.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Foundation for Semantic Analysis: </strong>After syntax validation, the parse tree serves as a foundation for further analysis. The semantic analyzer traverses the parse tree to check for logical errors, like type mismatches or undeclared variables.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Code Generation: </strong>During code generation, the compiler traverses the parse tree to produce intermediate code or machine code based on the structure of the tree.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Error Detection: </strong>If the source code violates the grammar rules, the parse tree cannot be constructed. The inability to build a valid parse tree signals a syntax error, allowing the compiler to pinpoint the location of the issue.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Optimization: </strong>Parse trees can be used for optimizing code, identifying redundant operations, and applying various optimizations based on the structure of the tree.</p>
   </section>

      <h4>Example of a Parse Tree</h4>
      <p>Let's apply this grammar to an example expression: `id + id * id`.</p>
      <p>1. Start with the start symbol E.</p>
      <p>2. Apply production rule `E → E + T` to expand E.</p>
      <p>3. Apply production rule `E → T` to the leftmost E.</p>
      <p>4. Apply production rule `T → F` to the leftmost T.</p>
      <p>5. Apply production rule `F → id` to F.</p>
      <p>6. Apply production rule `T → F` to the second T.</p>
      <p>7. Apply production rule `F → id` to the second F.</p>
      <p>8. Apply production rule `T → F` to the third T.</p>
      <p>9. Apply production rule `F → id` to the third F.</p>
      <p>The parse tree would look like this:</p>
      <pre>
                 E
               /   \
              E     +
             / \     \
            T   T     *
           / \  / \   \
          F  F F  F   id
          |   | |  |
          id  id id  id     
      </pre>

      <h4>Advantages of Parse Trees</h4>
      <li><strong>Clear Representation: </strong>Parse trees offer a clear, structured representation of the syntax of a program.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Reporting: </strong>They help in identifying and reporting syntax errors effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Foundation for Later Stages: </strong>Parse trees serve as the foundation for semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.</li>
      <li><strong>Support for Language Constructs: </strong>They help in representing complex language constructs like loops, conditionals, and expressions.</li>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <li><strong>Memory Usage: </strong>For large programs, parse trees can become quite large and consume significant memory.</li>
      <li><strong>Complexity with Ambiguous Grammars: </strong>For ambiguous grammars, multiple parse trees may exist for the same input, complicating the parsing process.</li>
      <li><strong>Computational Overhead: </strong>Constructing parse trees, especially for complex languages, can be computationally intensive.</li>
   </section> 
   <section>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Parse trees are essential structures in compiler design, playing a crucial role in validating syntax, facilitating semantic analysis, and supporting code generation. They provide a structured representation of the input program, ensuring that the program adheres to the grammar rules and serves as a foundation for further stages of compilation. Although they offer many advantages, managing large and ambiguous parse trees can be a challenge in more complex compilers.</p>
