        <h4>What is Nearest Neighbours</h4>
        <p><strong>Nearest Neighbours</strong>is a method used to classify or predict data based on the idea of "similarity". If you’ve ever chosen a movie to watch based on what’s similar to ones you've liked before — that's the core concept.</p>
        <p>At its core, the Nearest Neighbours approach says:</p>
        <p>If something looks similar to things we’ve already seen, it probably belongs in the same category.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>How Does It Work</h4>
        <p>Imagine you're at a party, and you don’t know anyone. You spot someone wearing a band t-shirt of your favorite music group and chatting about a show you like. You’d probably guess you’d get along with them. This is how the algorithm thinks.</p>
        <h5>In Nearest Neighbours:</h5>
        <p>We already have examples of items (these could be emails, photos, patients, or customers).</p>
        <p>We are given a new item (that we don't know much about).</p>
        <p>The algorithm looks at the most similar items (the "nearest neighbours").</p>
        <p>Then it makes a decision based on those similar items.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>What Does “Neighbour” Mean in This Context?</h4>
        <p>A neighbour is just something that is similar to something else.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking at a document, its neighbours could be other documents with similar words.</p>
        <p>If you’re analyzing images, its neighbours could be images with similar patterns or colors.</p>
        <p>The term "nearest" refers to how close or similar things are, not physically, but in terms of features or characteristics.</p>
    </section>

        <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
        <p><strong>No Training:</strong> This method doesn't need to "learn" in the usual sense. It just stores all the existing examples and makes decisions at the time of prediction.</p>
        <p><strong>Instance-Based Learning:</strong> It learns from the examples directly.</p>
        <p><strong>Lazy Learning:</strong> It delays the actual work until it needs to make a prediction.</p>
    </section>

        <h4>Types</h4>
        <p>There are mainly two ways Nearest Neighbours is used:</p>
        <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)</strong> – For classification and regression tasks.</li>
        <p><strong>Content-Based Recommendation</strong> – Finds similar items (e.g., books, music, videos).</p>
    </secton>
    <section>
        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p><strong>1. Spam Detection:</strong>Checks whether is this email similar to spam emails?</p>
        <p><strong>3. Medical Diagnosis:</strong>Does this patient have a condition similar to others?</p>
        <p><strong>4. Image Recognition:</strong>Checks Which known image is this new image most similar to?</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Real World Analogy</h4>
        <p>Think of Nearest Neighbours like this:</p>
        <p>You move to a new city and want to find a good pizza place. You ask five locals who live near you — they all recommend the same spot. You’ll likely try that place. </p>
        <p>Those five locals are your nearest neighbours, and you relied on their experience to make a decision.</p>
