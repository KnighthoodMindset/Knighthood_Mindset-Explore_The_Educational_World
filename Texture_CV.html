  <h3>Texture</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>In our everyday perception, we can distinguish between surfaces like grass, fabric, sand, or bricks — not just by color or shape, but because of a property known as texture. In the field of computer vision, texture plays a vital role in interpreting images that contain patterns or surface details.</p>
  <p>Texture refers to the visual patterns of spatial variations in intensity or color, typically repeating over a surface. It is used to describe the surface quality of objects and scenes. Unlike edges or corners, which are localized features, texture represents spatial relationships over a region — offering crucial information for segmentation, recognition, and classification.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>What is Texture?</h4>
  <p>In simple terms:</p>
  <blockquote>Texture is the feel or appearance of a surface or substance in an image, reflected by repeating patterns or intensity variations.</blockquote>
  <p>It is not defined at a single point, but is rather a property of a region. Texture does not have precise boundaries, but it contains repetitive or stochastic patterns of intensity.</p>
  <h5>Characteristics of Texture:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Regularity or randomness</li>
    <li>Coarseness or smoothness</li>
    <li>Directionality (orientation)</li>
    <li>Contrast</li>
    <li>Frequency of pattern</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Types of Texture</h4>

  <h5>1. Structural Texture</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Made up of basic primitive patterns (like lines, dots, or shapes) arranged in a repetitive or rule-based manner.</li>
    <li>Examples: brick walls, woven fabric</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>2. Statistical Texture</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>More random in appearance, lacking precise structure.</li>
    <li>Texture is described by statistical measures of intensity variation.</li>
    <li>Examples: grass, clouds, sand</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Why Texture Matters in Computer Vision</h4>
  <p>Texture provides valuable cues for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Segmentation: Dividing an image into textured regions (e.g., separating land types in satellite imagery)</li>
    <li>Classification: Identifying material types (e.g., cloth vs. metal)</li>
    <li>Recognition: Recognizing faces, fingerprints, skin diseases, etc.</li>
    <li>Object detection: Enhancing accuracy where shape or color is insufficient</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In many real-world images where edges or contours are weak or missing, texture becomes the primary visual clue.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Texture Analysis Methods</h4>
  <p>Texture can be analyzed using three major approaches:</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>1. Statistical Methods</h4>
  <p>These methods describe texture based on the distribution of pixel intensities in a region.</p>

  <h5>a. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Measures how often pairs of pixels with specific values and a specific spatial relationship occur.</li>
    <li>Features derived from GLCM:
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast</li>
        <li>Correlation</li>
        <li>Energy (Angular Second Moment)</li>
        <li>Homogeneity</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, in a GLCM, we compute how often pixel value i is next to value j in a given direction and distance.</p>

  <h5>b. Local Binary Pattern (LBP)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Compares each pixel to its neighbors to form a binary number.</li>
    <li>Very effective for texture classification and face recognition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>c. Statistical Moments</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Uses mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis of pixel intensities to describe texture.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>2. Structural Methods</h4>
  <p>Assume that texture is composed of basic patterns (called texels) repeated in a specific arrangement.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detect and analyze primitive shapes (e.g., lines, circles, etc.)</li>
    <li>Analyze arrangement (e.g., grid-like, random, parallel)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Suitable for:</b> Highly organized textures like fabric, tiles, architecture</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>3. Transform-Based Methods</h4>
  <p>These methods analyze texture in frequency or scale-space domains.</p>

  <h5>a. Fourier Transform</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Measures frequency content of an image.</li>
    <li>Detects repetitive patterns and orientation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>b. Wavelet Transform</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyzes texture at multiple resolutions (fine and coarse).</li>
    <li>Ideal for hierarchical textures like in nature or medical images.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>c. Gabor Filters</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply orientation-sensitive and frequency-sensitive filters.</li>
    <li>Mimic human visual perception.</li>
    <li>Widely used in face recognition and defect detection.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Applications of Texture in Computer Vision</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Medical Imaging: Classifying tissues, tumors, skin conditions</li>
    <li>Remote Sensing: Land cover classification (urban, forest, water)</li>
    <li>Industrial Inspection: Surface defect detection (scratches, dents)</li>
    <li>Face Recognition: Using LBP or Gabor filters for robust detection</li>
    <li>Textile Industry: Identifying cloth textures, pattern matching</li>
    <li>Animal Identification: Texture-based species recognition (fur, scales)</li>
    <li>Object Classification: Differentiating materials (wood, glass, metal)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Texture vs Color vs Shape</h4>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Suitable For</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Color</td>
      <td>Pixel intensity in RGB/HSV</td>
      <td>Simple, color-based classification</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Shape</td>
      <td>Contours, edges</td>
      <td>Object boundary detection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Texture</td>
      <td>Surface pattern across regions</td>
      <td>Material identification, surfaces</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Texture is often used in combination with other features (like shape and color) for a more holistic understanding.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Challenges in Texture Analysis</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Noise Sensitivity: Texture descriptors can be disrupted by noise.</li>
    <li>Scale and Orientation Variation: Patterns may appear differently under zoom or rotation.</li>
    <li>Illumination Dependence: Shadows or lighting changes affect texture visibility.</li>
    <li>Complexity in Natural Images: Real-world scenes contain mixed and irregular textures.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Modern solutions involve texture-invariant models or combining texture with deep learning techniques.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Texture and Deep Learning</h4>
  <p>While traditional texture analysis is rule-based, deep learning allows automatic feature extraction from raw pixels.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) can learn texture patterns through layers.</li>
    <li>Pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG capture texture as part of object recognition.</li>
    <li>Style Transfer in neural art generation also manipulates texture explicitly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Still, in many industrial and medical systems, classical texture analysis remains in use for its interpretability and speed.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Texture is a rich and informative visual cue that allows machines to go beyond shape and color and understand the fine details of surfaces and materials. By using statistical, structural, or transform-based methods, texture can be effectively analyzed and used in a wide range of applications — from satellite images to skin lesion diagnosis.</p>
  <p>Even in the era of deep learning, texture remains a foundational concept in computer vision — essential for segmentation, classification, and pattern recognition. Understanding how texture works gives students and developers a sharper insight into how machines perceive the real world.</p>
