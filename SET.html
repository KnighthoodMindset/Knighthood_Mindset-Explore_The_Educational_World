    <h3>Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <p>
      The Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) is an open-source, Python-based framework designed for penetration testers and ethical hackers to simulate advanced social engineering attacks. Developed by TrustedSec and maintained by security expert David Kennedy, SET automates and streamlines a wide variety of attack techniques focused on human manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, and SET provides a comprehensive platform for creating realistic, customizable attack scenarios.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h4>2. Purpose and Importance</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Realistic Simulation:</strong> SET helps security professionals simulate real-world social engineering attacks, allowing organizations to test their defenses and train employees.</li>
      <li><strong>Automated Toolkit:</strong> It combines multiple attack methods into a single easy-to-use tool, reducing the complexity of creating sophisticated social engineering attacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Customizable Payloads:</strong> Allows attackers or testers to craft targeted payloads such as phishing emails, malicious websites, and USB-based exploits.</li>
      <li><strong>Educational Tool:</strong> Security teams use SET to educate employees on the dangers of social engineering and how to recognize and avoid such attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Key Features of SET</h4>

    <h5>a. Phishing Attack Vectors</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>SET can generate phishing emails that appear legitimate.</li>
      <li>It supports credential harvesting by mimicking login pages of popular sites.</li>
      <li>Supports mass mailing and cloning legitimate emails (clone phishing).</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>b. Website Attack Vectors</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>SET hosts fake websites (e.g., fake Facebook login) to steal user credentials.</li>
      <li>Supports man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks to intercept traffic and data.</li>
      <li>Ability to use Java applet attacks or browser exploits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>c. Infectious Media Generator</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates malicious payloads embedded in USB devices.</li>
      <li>When plugged into a target machine, it can execute scripts or malware.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>d. Mass Mailer Attack</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Sends large volumes of phishing or spear phishing emails.</li>
      <li>Can spoof sender addresses to appear legitimate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>e. PowerShell Attack Vectors</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses PowerShell scripts to bypass security controls on Windows systems.</li>
      <li>Supports command execution and remote access payloads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>f. Payload Generator</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Generates payloads for different platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).</li>
      <li>Supports reverse shells, Meterpreter payloads, and more.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>4. Working of SET</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> SET runs through a menu-driven CLI interface, guiding the user through multiple attack options.</li>
      <li><strong>Selection of Attack Vector:</strong> User selects the type of social engineering attack (e.g., phishing, website attack).</li>
      <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> User customizes payloads, target details, and delivery methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution:</strong> SET automatically creates the payload, hosts fake sites, or sends phishing emails.</li>
      <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Credentials or session information collected from victims are stored and displayed.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Exploitation:</strong> Allows further exploitation, such as gaining remote shell access.</li>
    </ol>

  <section>
    <h4>7. Example Scenario</h4>
    <p>
      A penetration tester uses SET to simulate a spear phishing attack targeting the HR department:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SET clones a legitimate internal email.</li>
      <li>The email includes a link to a fake login page hosted by SET.</li>
      <li>HR employees entering credentials on this page unwittingly give access to the tester.</li>
      <li>The tester uses this access to demonstrate potential risks and recommend improvements.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
