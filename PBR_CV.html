        <h3>Point Based Representation</h3>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Point-based representation is a fundamental technique in 3D computer vision that involves representing a 3D object or scene using discrete points in space. Unlike mesh or volumetric representations that define surfaces or volumes, point-based methods capture only the essential surface information using a collection of 3D coordinates (x, y, z), and often include additional attributes like color (RGB), normal vectors, or intensity. This method forms the basis of many modern 3D scanning, reconstruction, and analysis systems.</p>

        <h4>What is Point-Based Representation?</h4>
        <p>A point cloud is the most common form of point-based representation. It is typically obtained from depth sensors (e.g., LiDAR, structured light, stereo cameras) or photogrammetry. Each point in a cloud represents a sample of the object’s surface, providing geometric information without the need for connectivity between the points.</p>
        <p>This form of representation is non-parametric, meaning it doesn’t require defining geometric primitives like triangles or voxels. Instead, it offers a direct, data-driven method of capturing the real-world geometry with high fidelity.</p>

        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Acquisition</strong>: A 3D sensor scans an object or environment and outputs a set of 3D coordinates. This can be done using:
                <ul>
                    <li>LiDAR (for autonomous vehicles)</li>
                    <li>RGB-D cameras (e.g., Kinect)</li>
                    <li>Stereo vision (depth from disparity)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Representation</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>The 3D data is stored as a set of points in 3D space.</li>
                    <li>Additional features may be associated with each point, such as color, surface normals, or reflectance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Processing</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Filtering is often used to remove noise.</li>
                    <li>Downsampling may be performed to reduce computational load.</li>
                    <li>Registration aligns multiple point clouds from different views.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Visualization and Analysis</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rendered using software like MeshLab, CloudCompare, or PCL (Point Cloud Library).</li>
                    <li>Algorithms analyze shapes, extract features, or generate 3D models.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
