        <h3>Sensor Network Technology</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>In the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT), Sensor Network Technology plays a foundational role by enabling devices to sense, monitor, and react to changes in their environment. A Sensor Network refers to a distributed group of interconnected sensors that collaboratively collect and transmit data to a central system or cloud platform. These networks form the nervous system of intelligent environments, enabling everything from smart cities and industrial automation to environmental monitoring and healthcare solutions.</p>
      <p>At its core, Sensor Network Technology is responsible for turning physical phenomena (such as temperature, humidity, motion, or light) into digital signals that machines can understand and process. This capability makes it one of the most essential technologies in cyber-physical systems and the digital transformation of the physical world.</p>

      <h4>Key Features of Sensor Network Technology</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Distributed Architecture: </strong>Sensors are geographically dispersed but connected to communicate as a unified system.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Wireless Communication: </strong>Most modern sensor networks use wireless protocols like Zigbee, LoRa, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Self-Organization: </strong>Nodes can automatically detect other nodes and configure network topologies.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Scalability: </strong>Networks can be expanded by simply adding more sensor nodes.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Real-Time Data Collection: </strong>Capable of gathering and transmitting data instantly for time-sensitive applications.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Power Efficiency: </strong>Designed to work with low power for long durations, often using batteries or energy harvesting.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Multi-Hop Routing: </strong>Data may travel across multiple nodes before reaching the destination, ensuring reach in large areas.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>How it works</h4>
      <p>Sensor Network Technology operates through a system of interconnected sensor nodes, each comprising a sensing unit, a microcontroller, a communication module, and a power source. These nodes are deployed in the target area where they detect various physical parameters like pressure, sound, motion, heat, or gas concentration. Once a node senses a change or event, it converts the physical data into digital format through Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC). This digital data is processed locally and then transmitted through wireless or wired communication channels.</p>
      <p>The data travels from the sensor nodes to a sink node or base station, often using multi-hop transmission where one node relays data to another. From the base station, the data is either sent to a cloud server, local gateway, or central processing system where it is analyzed, visualized, and acted upon. In many cases, the network supports bi-directional communication, allowing remote systems to also send commands back to the nodes (e.g., turning devices on or off based on sensor feedback).</p>
