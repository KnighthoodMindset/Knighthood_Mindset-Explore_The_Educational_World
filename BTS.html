Here is a **detailed theoretical explanation** of the topic **‚ÄúBasic Techniques of Scanning‚Äù** under **Ethical Hacking** for your **Tech Nexus** website:

## üîç **Basic Techniques of Scanning ‚Äì Ethical Hacking**

In ethical hacking, **scanning** refers to the process of actively probing a target network or system to discover live hosts, open ports, running services, and vulnerabilities. To effectively conduct scanning, ethical hackers utilize various **scanning techniques** depending on their objective ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs identifying accessible systems, detecting services, or fingerprinting operating systems.

Understanding the **basic techniques of scanning** is crucial, as they serve as the **foundation for advanced network penetration testing** and vulnerability assessments.

### üß≠ **1. Ping Sweep (ICMP Scanning)**

#### **Definition:**

Ping Sweep is a technique used to determine **which IP addresses are active** or "alive" on a network. It sends **ICMP Echo Requests** to multiple IP addresses and waits for **ICMP Echo Replies**.

#### **How It Works:**

* Sends a **ping (ICMP Echo Request)** to each IP address.
* Waits for a **response (ICMP Echo Reply)**.
* Hosts that respond are marked as **live**.

#### **Purpose:**

* Identify live systems in a subnet.
* Eliminate non-responsive IPs from further scanning.

#### **Limitations:**

* ICMP may be blocked by firewalls.
* Can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS).

#### **Example Tool:** `fping`, `nmap`, `ping`

### üåê **2. Port Scanning**

#### **Definition:**

Port scanning is used to discover **open ports** and **services** on a target system. Each port corresponds to a particular service or application.

#### **Types of Port Scanning:**

| Technique                     | Description                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TCP Connect Scan**          | Establishes full TCP connection (3-way handshake). Reliable but noisy.                                          |
| **SYN Scan (Half-open scan)** | Sends only SYN packets. If SYN-ACK is received, port is open. Stealthier.                                       |
| **FIN Scan**                  | Sends FIN packets without connection. If no response, the port may be open. Used to evade firewalls.            |
| **NULL Scan**                 | Sends a packet with no flags set. Open ports remain silent. Can bypass stateless firewalls.                     |
| **XMAS Scan**                 | Sends a packet with FIN, URG, and PUSH flags set (like a Christmas tree). Responses are interpreted for status. |

#### **Purpose:**

* Identify open/closed/filtered ports.
* Discover services and daemons.
* Map possible attack entry points.

#### **Example Tool:** `nmap`, `Netcat`

### üìç **3. Network Scanning**

#### **Definition:**

Network scanning is used to **identify active devices**, **network topology**, and **potential vulnerabilities** in a network.

#### **Techniques:**

* ARP scanning for local networks
* ICMP scanning for remote hosts
* TCP/UDP port detection
* Banner grabbing for identifying services

#### **Purpose:**

* Map network devices
* Identify unauthorized systems
* Determine available services

#### **Example Tools:** `Nmap`, `Angry IP Scanner`

### üß± **4. Vulnerability Scanning**

#### **Definition:**

Vulnerability scanning involves analyzing systems to detect **security flaws**, such as unpatched software, misconfigured services, or weak passwords.

#### **Types:**

* **Authenticated scan:** Requires credentials to probe systems deeply.
* **Unauthenticated scan:** Tests external vulnerabilities without login.

#### **Purpose:**

* Detect known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
* Identify insecure software versions
* Assess system health from a security perspective

#### **Example Tools:** `Nessus`, `OpenVAS`, `Nikto`

### üñ•Ô∏è **5. Operating System (OS) Fingerprinting**

#### **Definition:**

OS Fingerprinting helps determine the **operating system and its version** running on a target host.

#### **Types:**

* **Active Fingerprinting:** Sends crafted packets to elicit OS-specific responses.
* **Passive Fingerprinting:** Observes traffic without sending probes.

#### **Purpose:**

* Determine system type (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS)
* Customize further attacks or exploits

#### **Tools:** `Nmap`, `XProbe`, `p0f`

---

### üîß **6. Banner Grabbing**

#### **Definition:**

Banner grabbing is a technique where an attacker sends requests to a service and records the response headers, which often reveal the **software type, version, and configuration**.

#### **How it works:**

* Connects to open ports (like 80, 21, 22)
* Reads metadata or initial response
* Extracts service banners

#### **Purpose:**

* Discover software versions
* Identify vulnerabilities linked to specific versions
* Plan service-specific exploits

#### **Example:**

Using `telnet`:

```bash
telnet example.com 80
```

### üîÅ **7. UDP Scanning**

#### **Definition:**

Unlike TCP scanning, UDP scanning checks for services running over the **User Datagram Protocol**, which is **connectionless** and **harder to detect**.

#### **Challenges:**

* Lack of response may mean open or filtered
* Slower and less reliable than TCP scans
* Firewalls often block UDP packets

#### **Tools:** `Nmap -sU`

---

### üß† **Conclusion**

The basic techniques of scanning form the **cornerstone of ethical hacking**. Each scanning technique serves a specific purpose and is chosen based on the target environment and assessment goals. When used responsibly and with authorization, scanning helps **detect vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them**.

Ethical hackers must master these techniques to:

* Understand how attackers work
* Assess security defenses
* Provide informed remediation strategies

Mastery of scanning tools and methodologies lays the groundwork for the **exploitation**, **privilege escalation**, and **post-exploitation** phases that follow in a full penetration test.
