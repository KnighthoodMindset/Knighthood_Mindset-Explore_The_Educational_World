      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is not just a technological revolution—it’s a business transformation. At its core, IoT refers to the network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that allow them to connect and exchange data with other systems and devices over the internet. But beyond the gadgets and connectivity lies the true power of IoT: its ability to drive real-world applications, deliver intelligent services, and redefine business processes.</p>
      <p>IoT has moved far beyond basic automation or remote control. Today, it enables companies to optimize operations, reduce costs, predict customer needs, and create entirely new business models. It fuels smart cities, powers intelligent healthcare, revolutionizes manufacturing, and personalizes retail experiences. Every "thing" that can collect and transmit data now contributes to a larger digital ecosystem—where data-driven services can operate at unprecedented scale and intelligence.</p>
