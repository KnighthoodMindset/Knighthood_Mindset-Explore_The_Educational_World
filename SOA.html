  <h3>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>What is Service-Oriented Architecture?</h4>
  <p>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a software design approach where different services are provided to other components over a network using a communication protocol. These services are independent, loosely coupled, and can be reused across different applications.</p>
  <p>Each service performs a specific task and communicates with other services through standard protocols such as HTTP, SOAP, or REST.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Key Features of SOA</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Loose Coupling – Services are independent of each other.</li>
    <li>Interoperability – Different platforms and languages can work together.</li>
    <li>Reusability – Services can be used in multiple applications.</li>
    <li>Discoverability – Services can be searched and located easily.</li>
    <li>Standardized Communication – Uses protocols like XML, SOAP, REST.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Components of SOA</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Provider:</strong> Creates and publishes the service.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Consumer:</strong> Finds and uses the service.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Registry:</strong> A directory that lists all available services.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>How SOA Works</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>A Service Provider registers its service in a Service Registry.</li>
    <li>A Service Consumer searches for a required service in the registry.</li>
    <li>After locating the service, the consumer binds and calls the service.</li>
    <li>Services are accessed using web protocols like HTTP, SOAP, or REST.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Advantages of SOA</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Reusability – Write once, use many times.</li>
    <li>Scalability – Add new services without affecting others.</li>
    <li>Interoperability – Works across platforms and languages.</li>
    <li>Maintenance – Easier to update individual services.</li>
    <li>Productivity – Faster development using existing services.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Disadvantages of SOA</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Complexity – Requires careful design and management.</li>
    <li>Performance Overhead – More network communication can slow down performance.</li>
    <li>Security Risks – Services exposed over the network may be vulnerable.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Examples of SOA in Real Life</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Online Shopping:</strong> Services for product catalog, payment, shipping.</li>
    <li><strong>Banking Apps:</strong> Authentication, balance inquiry, money transfer.</li>
    <li><strong>Travel Booking:</strong> Flights, hotels, payments, email confirmations.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a powerful way to design software systems that are modular, flexible, and scalable. By breaking applications into independent services, SOA allows organizations to reuse code and adapt faster. However, security and performance must be managed carefully.</p>
