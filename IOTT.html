        <h3>Overview of internet of things</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) Technology refers to the broad range of technical components and systems that enable the development, deployment, and operation of IoT applications. These technologies include everything from hardware (sensors, microcontrollers) to connectivity standards, software platforms, cloud services, data analytics, and even security frameworks.</p>
      <p>Understanding IoT technology is essential because it provides the foundation on which smart devices communicate, analyze, and make decisions — often without human intervention. IoT is not a single technology, but rather a collection of technologies that together form a powerful and intelligent ecosystem.</p>

      <p><strong>Examples: </strong></p>
      <li>Arduino</li>
      <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
      <li>ESP32, ESP8266</li>
      <p>These systems are designed to consume low power and operate under limited computational resources, making them perfect for small, intelligent devices.</p>

      <h5>3. Network & Connectivity Technologies</h5>
      <p>IoT devices must communicate with each other or with a central system. To enable this, a range of connectivity technologies are used.</p>
      <p><strong>Common IoT Communication Technologies</strong></p>
      <li><strong>Wi-Fi: </strong>Common for indoor devices like smart home appliances.</li>
      <li><strong>Bluetooth & BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy): </strong>Used in wearable devices and short-range communication.</li>
      <li><strong>Zigbee: </strong>Low-power, low-data rate technology ideal for home automation.</li>
      <li><strong>LoRa (Long Range): </strong>Best suited for long-range, low-power applications (e.g., agriculture).</li>
      <li><strong>NFC (Near Field Communication): </strong>For very short-range communication.</li>
      <li><strong>Cellular (3G, 4G, 5G): </strong>Ideal for mobile IoT devices and real-time data transfer.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethernet: </strong>Wired connection used in industrial or fixed systems.</li>
      <p>Each of these technologies has its own range, power consumption, speed, and cost factors.</p>

      <h5>4. Cloud Computing</h5>
      <p>Cloud computing refers to the use of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data.</p>
      <p><strong>Importance in IoT</strong></p>
      <li>Acts as a centralized platform for data storage and analytics.</li>
      <li>Provides scalability – the ability to handle millions of connected devices.</li>
      <li>Offers real-time monitoring, data visualization, and remote access.</li>
      <p><strong>Examples of cloud platforms for IoT:</strong></p>
      <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS IoT)</li>
      <li>Microsoft Azure IoT Hub</li>
      <li>Google Cloud IoT</li>
      <li>IBM Watson IoT</li>
      <p>Cloud computing allows developers and companies to create smart dashboards, control devices remotely, and implement predictive analytics.</p>

      <h5>5. Big Data & Analytics</h5>
      <p>IoT devices generate massive volumes of data. Big Data technologies help in:</p>
      <li>Collecting this data</li>
      <li>Storing it securely</li>
      <li>Analyzing it for meaningful patterns or behaviours</li>
      <p>Data analytics enables:</p>
      <li>Predictive maintenance in industries</li>
      <li>Personalized recommendations in retail</li>
      <li>Health monitoring alerts in healthcare</li>

      <h5>6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML)</h5>
      <p>Enhances the intelligence of IoT systems</p>
      <p>It allow devices to:</p>
      <li>Learn from patterns and usage behavior.</li>
      <li>Make decisions without manual input.</li>
      <li>Adapt and improve over time.</li>

      <p>With AI and ML integration, devices can even learn from data and make intelligent decisions.</p>

      <h5>7. Edge Computing</h5>
      <p>A distributed computing model where data is processed near the source (the device), instead of sending everything to the cloud.</p>
      <p>It reduces latency, saves bandwidth, increases speed and privacy</p>
      <p>Edge computing is highly beneficial in:</p>
      <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
