      <h3>Photometric Stereo</h3>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>Photometric Stereo is a powerful computer vision method used to reconstruct the 3D shape of a surface by observing it under different lighting conditions, but from a fixed camera viewpoint. Unlike Shape from Shading, which relies on a single image and assumes lighting direction, Photometric Stereo uses multiple images taken under known light directions, providing richer information for reconstructing the surface normals and depth map.</p>
      <p>This technique is especially valuable in applications where high-precision surface modeling is required, such as cultural heritage preservation, biomedical imaging, and industrial inspection.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Basic Principle</h4>
      <p>The key idea behind Photometric Stereo is:</p>
      <blockquote>
        By illuminating an object from various known light sources and capturing the reflected intensities at each pixel, we can determine the orientation (normal vector) of the surface at that point.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Imaging Setup</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Camera: Captures all images from the same viewpoint.</li>
        <li>Variable Light Sources: Multiple directional lights are turned on one at a time.</li>
        <li>Assumption of Lambertian Surface: The surface reflects light diffusely (same brightness when viewed from any angle).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let’s say we take n images, each under a different known light direction L₁, L₂, ..., Lₙ.</p>
      <p>For each pixel (x, y), the intensity I₁, I₂, ..., Iₙ in those images forms a system of equations:</p>
      <pre>
I₁ = ρ * (N · L₁)
I₂ = ρ * (N · L₂)
...
Iₙ = ρ * (N · Lₙ)
      </pre>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I₁, I₂, ..., Iₙ are observed intensities at a pixel under different lights.</li>
        <li>ρ is the surface albedo (reflectivity).</li>
        <li>N is the unit surface normal vector.</li>
        <li>L₁, L₂, ..., Lₙ are known lighting direction vectors.</li>
        <li>(N · Lᵢ) is the dot product between normal and light direction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By solving this system (usually via least squares when n ≥ 3), we estimate N and ρ.</p>
      <p>Once normals (N) are known at every pixel, surface depth (z) can be estimated by integrating the gradient field derived from the normals.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Photometric Stereo is a robust and elegant approach for extracting fine-grained 3D surface information by utilizing multiple lighting directions with a static camera. It bypasses the inherent ambiguity of single-image techniques and offers pixel-wise surface normal and reflectance estimation. While it assumes ideal lighting and surface properties, modern adaptations using deep learning and multi-view integration are making Photometric Stereo more versatile and powerful than ever.</p>
