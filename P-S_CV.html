## üåÑ Photometric Stereo ‚Äî Computer Vision Technique

### üîç Introduction

**Photometric Stereo** is a powerful computer vision method used to reconstruct the **3D shape of a surface** by observing it under **different lighting conditions**, but **from a fixed camera viewpoint**. Unlike **Shape from Shading**, which relies on a single image and assumes lighting direction, Photometric Stereo uses **multiple images** taken under **known light directions**, providing richer information for reconstructing the **surface normals** and **depth map**.

This technique is especially valuable in applications where high-precision surface modeling is required, such as cultural heritage preservation, biomedical imaging, and industrial inspection.

### üí° Basic Principle

The key idea behind Photometric Stereo is:

> **By illuminating an object from various known light sources and capturing the reflected intensities at each pixel, we can determine the orientation (normal vector) of the surface at that point.**

### üì∏ Imaging Setup

1. **Fixed Camera**: Captures all images from the same viewpoint.
2. **Variable Light Sources**: Multiple directional lights are turned on one at a time.
3. **Assumption of Lambertian Surface**: The surface reflects light diffusely (same brightness when viewed from any angle).

Let‚Äôs say we take **n images**, each under a different known light direction **L‚ÇÅ, L‚ÇÇ, ..., L‚Çô**.

For each pixel (x, y), the intensity I‚ÇÅ, I‚ÇÇ, ..., I‚Çô in those images forms a system of equations:

```
I‚ÇÅ = œÅ * (N ¬∑ L‚ÇÅ)
I‚ÇÇ = œÅ * (N ¬∑ L‚ÇÇ)
...
I‚Çô = œÅ * (N ¬∑ L‚Çô)
```

Where:

* **I‚ÇÅ, I‚ÇÇ, ..., I‚Çô** are observed intensities at a pixel under different lights.
* **œÅ** is the surface albedo (reflectivity).
* **N** is the unit surface normal vector.
* **L‚ÇÅ, L‚ÇÇ, ..., L‚Çô** are known lighting direction vectors.
* **(N ¬∑ L·µ¢)** is the dot product between normal and light direction.

By solving this system (usually via least squares when n ‚â• 3), we estimate **N** and **œÅ**.

Once normals (**N**) are known at every pixel, **surface depth (z)** can be estimated by integrating the gradient field derived from the normals.

| **Lighting Calibration**           | Inaccurate light direction measurements lead to incorrect normal estimation.        |
| **Integration of Normals**         | Reconstructing depth from normals is mathematically complex and error-prone.        |
| **Specular Highlights**            | Bright reflections violate the Lambertian assumption and affect normal calculation. |

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

**Photometric Stereo** is a robust and elegant approach for extracting fine-grained 3D surface information by utilizing multiple lighting directions with a static camera. It bypasses the inherent ambiguity of single-image techniques and offers pixel-wise surface normal and reflectance estimation. While it assumes ideal lighting and surface properties, modern adaptations using deep learning and multi-view integration are making Photometric Stereo more versatile and powerful than ever.
