      <h3>Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with keras</h3>
      <h4>What are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)?</h4>
      <p>
        Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They are designed to recognize patterns and relationships in data through a network of interconnected units called neurons.
      </p>
      <P>
        ANNs are especially powerful in handling complex data like images, audio, and text. They can learn from experience, adapt to changing inputs, and improve performance over time.
      </P>

    <section>
      <p>Keras is a popular deep learning framework that allows you to build and train ANNs with ease.</p>

    <h4>Building ANNs with Keras</h4>
    <p><strong>1. Define the Model Architecture:</strong><p>Define the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions for your ANN model.</p></p>
    <p><strong>2. Compile the Model:</strong><p>Compile the model with a loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.</p></p>
    <p><strong>3. Train the Model:</strong><p>Train the model on your dataset using Keras' built-in training algorithms.</p></p>

      <h4>Structure of an ANN</h4>
      <ul>
        <p><strong>1.Input Layer:</strong><li> Accepts the input features.</li><li>each neuron represents represents one feature of the input</li></p>
        <p><strong>2.Hidden Layers:</strong><li>hidden layers perform compuform computations and extract features</li><li>Multiple hidden layers are used in deep neural networks</li><li> It applies activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid or Tanh </li></p>
        <p><strong>3.Output Layer:</strong><li> Returns the final result based on the problem type.</li></p>

      <h4>How ANNs Learn</h4>
      <p>
        ANNs learn by adjusting the weights and biases of neurons during training. This is done using a technique called <strong>backpropagation</strong>, which minimizes the error between predicted and actual output using optimization algorithms like <strong>Gradient Descent.</strong>
