  <h3>Cloud Computing and Service Models</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>What is Cloud Computing?</h4>
  <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more—over the internet (called “the cloud”). This allows users to access and store data and applications on remote servers instead of on their personal devices or local servers.</p>

<section>
  <h4>Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>On-demand self-service</li>
    <li>Broad network access</li>
    <li>Resource pooling</li>
    <li>Rapid elasticity</li>
    <li>Measured service</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Cloud Service Models</h4>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h4>
  <p>IaaS provides the basic infrastructure services like virtual machines, storage, and networks. It is most suitable for system administrators and IT professionals who want to manage software and OS on top of provided hardware.</p>
  <p><strong>Example providers:</strong> Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full control over operating systems and applications</li>
    <li>Pay-as-you-go model</li>
    <li>Scalable and flexible</li>
    <li>Best for hosting websites, backup, and disaster recovery</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h4>
  <p>PaaS provides a platform that includes operating systems, programming languages, libraries, and tools for developers to build and deploy applications. Developers don’t need to manage the infrastructure; they can focus on building the app.</p>
  <p><strong>Example providers:</strong> Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Services, Heroku</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fast development and deployment</li>
    <li>Reduces management tasks</li>
    <li>Supports multiple programming languages</li>
    <li>Best for developers focusing on application coding</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>3. Software as a Service (SaaS)</h4>
  <p>SaaS delivers fully functional software applications over the internet. Users don’t have to install or maintain the software. Everything is managed by the service provider.</p>
  <p><strong>Example providers:</strong> Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs), Microsoft 365, Dropbox, Salesforce</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accessible from any device with internet</li>
    <li>No need for installation</li>
    <li>Automatic updates</li>
    <li>Best for end-users</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Comparison of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</h4>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>IaaS</th>
      <th>PaaS</th>
      <th>SaaS</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Control Level</td>
      <td>Most control (OS, apps)</td>
      <td>Medium control (apps only)</td>
      <td>Least control (just use)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User Type</td>
      <td>System Admins</td>
      <td>Developers</td>
      <td>End Users</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Examples</td>
      <td>AWS EC2, Google Compute</td>
      <td>Azure App Services, Heroku</td>
      <td>Gmail, Dropbox</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h4>Benefits of Cloud Computing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cost Efficiency</li>
    <li>Scalability</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Backup and Recovery</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses and users interact with technology. The service models (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) offer different levels of control and flexibility to suit various needs—from infrastructure management to full application use. Organizations can choose the appropriate model based on their goals, technical skills, and budget.</p>
