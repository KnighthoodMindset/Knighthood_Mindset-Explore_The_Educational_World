        <h3>Introduction to Syntax Directed Translation (SDT)</h3>
        <p>Syntax Directed Translation (SDT) is a method used in compiler design to associate semantic rules with the grammar of a programming language. It integrates syntax analysis with semantic processing by attaching actions or rules to the grammar productions.</p>
        <p>It allows the compiler to translate source code into intermediate representations, perform type checking, generate symbol tables, and produce target code based on the structure of the parse tree created during syntax analysis.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>What Does Syntax-Directed Mean?</h4>
        <p>The term “syntax-directed” implies that the semantics (meaning) of a programming language construct is derived from its syntactic structure. Each grammar rule has associated semantic rules, and when the rule is applied during parsing, its corresponding semantic actions are executed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Role in Compiler Design</h4>
        <p>In the syntax-directed translation model, semantic information (like types, scope, or code generation details) is attached to the grammar using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attributes</li>
            <li>Translation rules</li>
            <li>Semantic actions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This approach is especially useful during phases like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type checking</li>
            <li>Intermediate code generation</li>
            <li>Syntax tree construction</li>
            <li>Error reporting</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Components of Syntax Directed Translation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Context-Free Grammar (CFG)</strong><br>
                A base grammar describing the syntactic structure of the language.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Attributes</strong><br>
                Extra information associated with grammar symbols:
                <ul>
                    <li>Synthesized Attributes: Computed from children nodes (bottom-up)</li>
                    <li>Inherited Attributes: Computed from parent or sibling nodes (top-down or lateral)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Semantic Rules</strong><br>
                Define how attributes are computed. These are often expressed in terms of equations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>SDT Scheme</strong><br>
                A grammar where productions have embedded semantic actions (code or pseudo-code) that operate on attributes.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Example of Syntax Directed Translation</h4>
        <p>Consider the grammar:</p>
        <pre>
E → E + T  
E → T  
T → id
        </pre>
        <p>To compute the value of an arithmetic expression like <code>a + b</code>, we can associate attributes as follows:</p>
        <pre>
E → E1 + T      { E.val = E1.val + T.val }
E → T           { E.val = T.val }
T → id          { T.val = lookup(id) }
        </pre>
        <p>Here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>val</code> is a synthesized attribute</li>
            <li><code>lookup(id)</code> refers to retrieving the value of the identifier from the symbol table.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Types of Syntax Directed Definitions (SDD)</h4>
        <p>There are two main types:</p>

        <h5>S-Attributed Definition</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses only synthesized attributes</li>
            <li>Easier to implement during bottom-up parsing</li>
            <li>Suitable for LR parsers</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>L-Attributed Definition</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows both synthesized and inherited attributes</li>
            <li>Can be evaluated during top-down parsing</li>
            <li>Suitable for LL parsers</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Code Optimization</td>
                <td>Helps guide optimizations using semantic information</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bridges the gap between syntax and semantics</li>
            <li>Enables modular design of the compiler</li>
            <li>Facilitates intermediate code generation during parsing</li>
            <li>Makes it easier to perform type checking and translation simultaneously</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing inherited attributes can be complex</li>
            <li>Evaluation of attributes must follow dependency rules</li>
            <li>Some grammars need to be transformed to suit SDD constraints</li>
            <li>Error handling in SDT can be tricky if the semantic actions are too interdependent</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Syntax Directed Translation is a powerful technique that enables a compiler to make semantic decisions based on syntactic structure. It forms the foundation for semantic analysis and code generation in modern compilers. By integrating attributes and semantic rules into grammar productions, SDT provides a structured and efficient way to process source code beyond just syntax checking.</p>
