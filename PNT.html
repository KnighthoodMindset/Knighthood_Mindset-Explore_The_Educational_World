### üîπ **3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

**Definition:**
A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** is a network designed to cover a **larger geographic area** than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. A MAN typically spans an entire city or a large campus and is often used by municipalities, campuses, or large organizations.

**How it works:**
MANs are usually established through high-speed fiber optic cables or leased lines that connect various LANs. They can support services like internet access, VoIP (Voice over IP), and data transfer across various local offices.

#### **Example Applications of MAN:**

* Connecting various branches of an organization within a city.
* Public Wi-Fi networks in cities.
* Citywide data collection and monitoring systems.

**Advantages:**

* **High speed**: Faster than WANs, making it suitable for large urban areas.
* **Cost-effective**: MANs can be more affordable than implementing WAN infrastructure across an entire region.
* **Supports more devices**: Can accommodate multiple LANs and devices within a city.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Limited range**: MANs are geographically limited to the boundaries of a city or metropolitan area.
* **Complex setup**: Setting up and maintaining a MAN can be expensive and technically challenging.

### üîπ **4. Wide Area Network (WAN)**

**Definition:**
A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** spans a **very large geographic area**, often covering cities, countries, or even continents. WANs are commonly used by large organizations or government agencies that need to interconnect offices, data centers, and branches spread across different regions.

**How it works:**
WANs utilize **public or private communication infrastructure** such as telephone lines, fiber optics, or satellite links. They may be built using technologies like **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**, **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**, or **Internet connectivity**.

#### **Example WAN Use Cases:**

* Connecting remote branches of a corporation.
* Providing cloud access to employees in different locations.
* Enabling communication between global offices.

**Advantages:**

* **Global connectivity**: Allows interconnectivity between geographically dispersed locations.
* **Scalability**: WANs can handle large-scale network infrastructure with numerous endpoints.
* **Centralized data**: Enterprises can centralize their data centers, which can be accessed from multiple locations.

**Disadvantages:**

* **High cost**: WANs are expensive to implement, especially when using private infrastructure.
* **Complex management**: The larger the network, the more complicated the administration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
* **Latency**: Due to the vast distances covered, WANs can experience higher latency compared to LANs and MANs.
