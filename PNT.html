    <h3>Primary Network Types</h3>
    <p>In the realm of computer networks, various types of networks exist, each designed to serve specific purposes and meet different organizational or personal needs. Understanding these primary network types is essential for designing and securing networks, as well as for understanding how data is transmitted and managed across different environments.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h4>What are Network Types?</h4>
    <p>A network type refers to a specific configuration or architecture of a network, which dictates how devices are connected, how data flows between devices, and the range or coverage of the network. These networks can be classified based on the physical layout, scale, communication protocol, and purpose.</p>
    <p>Here, we'll explore the primary network types based on their scale, purpose, and the topology (how devices are physically or logically connected).</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h5>1. Personal Area Network (PAN)</h5>
    <strong>Definition:</strong>
    <p>A Personal Area Network (PAN) is the smallest network type, typically involving devices within a close proximity—such as within an individual's personal workspace, home, or office. It is primarily used for connecting devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearable devices.</p>

    <strong>How it works:</strong>
    <p>A PAN can be established using wired (USB) or wireless technologies like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, or Infrared (IR). PANs typically have a limited range, usually up to 100 meters, and they support only a small number of devices.</p>

    <strong>Example Devices in a PAN:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Smartphones and laptops</li>
        <li>Wireless headphones</li>
        <li>Printers</li>
        <li>Wearable devices (smartwatches)</li>
    </ul>
