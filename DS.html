  <h3>Digital Signature</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
  <p>A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages, documents, or software. It functions similarly to a handwritten signature or a stamped seal but provides far more security and is difficult to forge.</p>
  <p>Digital signatures ensure that the message or document has been created by a known sender (authentication), has not been altered in transit (integrity), and that the sender cannot deny sending it (non-repudiation).</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>2. Importance of Digital Signatures</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Confirms the identity of the sender.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensures the content has not been altered since signing.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Repudiation:</strong> Prevents the sender from denying their involvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Validity:</strong> Many countries recognize digital signatures as legally binding.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>3. How Digital Signatures Work</h4>
  <p>Digital signatures rely on asymmetric cryptography (public key cryptography) and hash functions. The process involves the following steps:</p>

  <h5>Step 1: Hashing the Message</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>The sender applies a hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to the original message/document.</li>
    <li>This produces a fixed-length message digest unique to the content.</li>
    <li>Even a tiny change in the message will produce a different hash value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Step 2: Encrypting the Hash</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>The sender uses their private key to encrypt the message digest.</li>
    <li>This encrypted hash becomes the digital signature.</li>
    <li>The original message is sent along with this digital signature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Step 3: Verification by the Receiver</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>The receiver receives both the message and the digital signature.</li>
    <li>The receiver applies the same hash function to the received message to generate their own hash.</li>
    <li>The receiver then decrypts the digital signature using the sender’s public key, revealing the original hash.</li>
    <li>If the decrypted hash matches the newly computed hash, the signature is valid, confirming authenticity and integrity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Digital Signature Algorithms</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman): One of the first widely used public key algorithms, supports both encryption and digital signatures.</li>
    <li>DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm): Specifically designed for digital signatures, standardized by NIST.</li>
    <li>ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm): Uses elliptic curve cryptography for smaller keys and faster operations with strong security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>10. Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Digital signatures are a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, providing a secure and trustworthy means of validating the authenticity and integrity of digital communications. Understanding their operation and potential vulnerabilities is essential for ethical hackers and security professionals tasked with protecting sensitive information.</p>
