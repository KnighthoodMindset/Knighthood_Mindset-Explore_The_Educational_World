# **Identity Theft**

---

## **1. Introduction**

**Identity theft** is a serious cybercrime where attackers steal and use someone else‚Äôs personal information to impersonate them, usually for malicious or financial gain. Unlike other forms of hacking that target systems, identity theft targets individuals, exploiting their personal data such as **Social Security numbers, bank credentials, login information, or biometric data**.

> üß† **Definition**: Identity theft is the deliberate use of another person‚Äôs identity, typically to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in that person‚Äôs name.

It is considered a **major cyber threat** in both personal and corporate domains, and it's commonly facilitated by methods like **phishing, sniffing, malware, and social engineering**.

## **3. How Identity Theft Happens**

Identity theft can occur in various ways, especially when users are unaware of their digital security practices. Common methods include:

### üîì **1. Phishing Attacks**

Fake emails, websites, or messages trick users into providing personal data.

### üåê **2. Sniffing**

Attackers use sniffers to capture unencrypted data packets in transit over insecure networks.

### üß† **3. Social Engineering**

Manipulating individuals into revealing confidential data like login credentials or banking information.

### üíª **4. Malware & Keyloggers**

Malicious software records keystrokes or extracts files to collect passwords, PINs, or personal data.

### üîß **5. Data Breaches**

Hackers exploit vulnerabilities in company databases to steal large volumes of customer information.

### üìÑ **6. Dumpster Diving**

## **5. Real-Life Examples**

### üéØ **Example 1: Target Data Breach (2013)**

Over **40 million credit card records** and **70 million personal details** were stolen via a malware attack on Target‚Äôs POS systems. Many of these were later used for identity theft.

### üéØ **Example 2: Equifax Breach (2017)**
