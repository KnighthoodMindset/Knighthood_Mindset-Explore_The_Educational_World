# **Types of Phishing Attacks**

---

## **1. Introduction**

Phishing attacks come in **various forms**, each tailored to exploit different weaknesses in human behavior and digital infrastructure. Understanding these types is crucial for ethical hackers, cybersecurity professionals, and users to identify threats and implement effective countermeasures.

Phishing is not limited to emails alone; it spans across text messages, phone calls, social media platforms, malicious websites, and even in-person tactics.

---

## **2. Classification of Phishing Attacks**

Phishing attacks are broadly categorized based on the **medium of communication**, **target specificity**, and **mode of execution**. The major types include:

---

### **1. Email Phishing**

**Definition**: The most common form of phishing where attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from trusted sources.

**Features**:

* Generic greetings (e.g., “Dear user”)
* Suspicious links or attachments
* Urgent or alarming language

**Example**:
An email claiming to be from your bank asking you to verify your account by clicking on a link.

**Tools used**:

* SET (Social Engineer Toolkit)
* Phishing email templates
* Email spoofers

---

### **2. Spear Phishing**

**Definition**: A targeted version of phishing directed at a specific individual, organization, or business.

**Features**:

* Customized content using personal details (e.g., name, job title, company)
* More convincing than generic phishing
* Often used in **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**

**Example**:
An attacker sends an email to a company's finance officer impersonating the CEO, asking for an urgent wire transfer.

**Target**: Usually high-level executives, HR, finance, or IT departments.

---

### **3. Whaling (CEO Fraud)**

**Definition**: A specialized spear phishing attack that targets high-profile individuals such as CEOs, CFOs, and other executives.

**Features**:

* Carefully crafted to look like high-level business communication
* May involve legal, tax, or financial content
* High stakes (can lead to millions in losses)

**Example**:
An attacker impersonates the company’s CEO and sends an urgent email to the finance department requesting funds for a secret merger.

---

### **4. Smishing (SMS Phishing)**

**Definition**: Phishing attacks conducted through **SMS (Short Message Service)** messages.

**Features**:

* Fake messages from banks, delivery services, or tech support
* Include malicious links or callback numbers

**Example**:
“You’ve won a gift card! Click here to claim: \[malicious link]”

**Risks**:

* Link may install malware or redirect to phishing websites
* Victims may call attackers directly, giving away sensitive info

---

### **5. Vishing (Voice Phishing)**

**Definition**: Phishing conducted via **voice calls**, often using VoIP technology.

**Features**:

* Attackers pretend to be from technical support, government agencies, or banks
* Use caller ID spoofing to appear legitimate

**Example**:
A “bank officer” calls and asks you to verify your account number due to “suspicious activity.”

**Notable Incidents**:

* Attackers impersonating IRS or tech support to scam elderly victims.

---

### **6. Pharming**

**Definition**: A type of phishing where users are redirected from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones without their knowledge.

**Techniques used**:

* DNS poisoning
* Host file manipulation

**Example**:
Typing `www.mybank.com` in the browser takes you to a fake website, even though the address looks correct.

**Outcome**: Victim enters credentials that are harvested by the attacker.

---

### **7. Clone Phishing**

**Definition**: An attack where a **legitimate email is cloned**, and its attachment or link is replaced with a malicious version.

**Features**:

* Appears to come from a known sender
* Same content as previous legitimate email

**Example**:
A duplicate of a work email with “updated document attached,” but the document contains malware.

---

### **8. Angler Phishing**

**Definition**: Phishing using **social media platforms** to lure victims.

**Techniques**:

* Fake customer support accounts
* Malicious links in comments, posts, or DMs

**Example**:
A fake Twitter support account responds to a complaint tweet with a link to “resolve the issue,” leading to a phishing site.

---

### **9. Search Engine Phishing**

**Definition**: Attackers create **fraudulent websites** that are indexed by search engines to trap unsuspecting users.

**Example**:
A user searches for “free antivirus download” and ends up downloading malware from a top-listed fake site.

**How it works**:

* Use of SEO techniques to rank malicious websites high in search results.

---

### **10. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Phishing**

**Definition**: The attacker intercepts communication between the user and the legitimate server, often during public Wi-Fi usage.

**Scenario**:

1. Victim logs into a public Wi-Fi hotspot.
2. Attacker acts as a relay between victim and target site.
3. Captures credentials or sensitive data.

---

### **11. Malware-Based Phishing**

**Definition**: Involves sending malware (keyloggers, ransomware, spyware) via attachments or downloads.

**Example**:

* Phishing email includes a Word document that, when opened, activates macros that download malware.

**Goal**: Monitor victim activity, steal data, or hold systems for ransom.
