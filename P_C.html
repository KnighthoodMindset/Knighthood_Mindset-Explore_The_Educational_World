    <h3>Password Cracking</h3>

    <section>
      <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
      <p>Password Cracking is the process of recovering passwords from stored or transmitted data using various techniques. It is a fundamental part of System Hacking, aimed at gaining unauthorized access to systems, networks, or applications by breaking password-based authentication mechanisms. Both ethical hackers and cybercriminals use password cracking, but for opposite purposes — ethical hackers use it to identify and fix vulnerabilities, while attackers exploit it to breach systems.</p>
<p>Passwords are the first line of defense in most systems, and once they are compromised, attackers can gain control over critical resources. Hence, password cracking is one of the most targeted and studied aspects of cybersecurity.</p>

      <h4>2. Why Passwords are Cracked</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>To gain unauthorized access to systems and user accounts.</li>
<li>To escalate privileges within a compromised system.</li>
<li>To access encrypted or protected files.</li>
<li>To perform lateral movement within a network.</li>
<li>To demonstrate security weaknesses in ethical hacking engagements.</li>
</ul>
    </section>

      <h4>3. Password Storage and Hashing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Most systems don’t store passwords in plain text. Instead, they store hashes of passwords.</li>
        <li>A hash is a fixed-length string generated by a one-way cryptographic function.</li>
        <li>Common hashing algorithms:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>MD5</strong></li>
            <li><strong>SHA-1</strong></li>
            <li><strong>SHA-256</strong></li>
            <li><strong>bcrypt</strong>, <strong>scrypt</strong>, <strong>PBKDF2</strong> (stronger, more secure)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Salting is often added to hashes to increase security and uniqueness.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h4>4. Types of Password Cracking Techniques</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>a. Brute Force Attack</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Tries all possible character combinations until the correct one is found.</li>
            <li>Guarantees success but is extremely slow for complex passwords.</li>
            <li>Example: Trying “aaaa”, “aaab”, ..., “zzzz”.</li>
            <li>Time-consuming and CPU-intensive.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>b. Dictionary Attack</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Uses a predefined list of commonly used passwords.</li>
            <li>Faster than brute force but only works if the password is in the dictionary.</li>
            <li>List can be custom-built or downloaded (e.g., RockYou.txt).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>c. Hybrid Attack</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Combines dictionary and brute force techniques.</li>
            <li>Example: Adding numbers to the end of dictionary words — “password123”.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>d. Rainbow Table Attack</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Uses precomputed hash tables to crack hashes quickly.</li>
            <li>If the hash exists in the rainbow table, password is found instantly.</li>
            <li>Defeated by salting, which makes each hash unique.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>e. Phishing and Social Engineering</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Tricks users into revealing passwords.</li>
            <li>Not technically “cracking”, but achieves the same result.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>f. Shoulder Surfing and Keylogging</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Physically or digitally observes password entry.</li>
            <li>Keyloggers record every keystroke, capturing passwords as users type.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>g. Guessing</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Manual attempt based on user’s personal information (e.g., birthday, pet name).</li>
            <li>Often effective against weak or default passwords.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>8. Real-World Examples</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LinkedIn Data Breach (2012)</strong>: Over 117 million passwords leaked — most were easily cracked due to poor hashing (SHA-1 without salt).</li>

        <li><strong>RockYou Leak</strong>: A widely used password list (32 million) originated from a poorly secured database.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>10. Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Password Cracking is both a threat and a diagnostic tool — while attackers use it to compromise systems, ethical hackers use it to strengthen password policies and secure user accounts. As password-based authentication remains widespread, it is essential to understand and guard against these cracking techniques. Organizations should implement robust security mechanisms and educate users on best practices to defend against password-related breaches.</p>
