Here is a **long and detailed explanation** for the topic **"Password Cracking"**, suitable for **Ethical Hacking Unit 3** notes:

# **Password Cracking**

## **1. Introduction**

**Password Cracking** is the process of recovering passwords from stored or transmitted data using various techniques. It is a fundamental part of **System Hacking**, aimed at gaining unauthorized access to systems, networks, or applications by breaking password-based authentication mechanisms. Both ethical hackers and cybercriminals use password cracking, but for opposite purposes — **ethical hackers use it to identify and fix vulnerabilities**, while **attackers exploit it to breach systems**.

Passwords are the **first line of defense** in most systems, and once they are compromised, attackers can gain control over critical resources. Hence, password cracking is one of the most targeted and studied aspects of cybersecurity.

## **2. Why Passwords are Cracked**

* To **gain unauthorized access** to systems and user accounts.
* To **escalate privileges** within a compromised system.
* To **access encrypted or protected files**.
* To **perform lateral movement** within a network.
* To **demonstrate security weaknesses** in ethical hacking engagements.

## **3. Password Storage and Hashing**

Before diving into cracking, it’s important to understand how passwords are typically stored:

* Most systems **don’t store passwords in plain text**. Instead, they store **hashes** of passwords.
* A **hash** is a fixed-length string generated by a one-way cryptographic function.
* Common hashing algorithms:

  * **MD5**
  * **SHA-1**
  * **SHA-256**
  * **bcrypt**, **scrypt**, **PBKDF2** (stronger, more secure)
* **Salting** is often added to hashes to increase security and uniqueness.

---

## **4. Types of Password Cracking Techniques**

### **a. Brute Force Attack**

* Tries all possible character combinations until the correct one is found.
* Guarantees success but is **extremely slow** for complex passwords.
* Example: Trying “aaaa”, “aaab”, ..., “zzzz”.
* **Time-consuming and CPU-intensive**.

### **b. Dictionary Attack**

* Uses a **predefined list of commonly used passwords**.
* Faster than brute force but only works if the password is in the dictionary.
* List can be custom-built or downloaded (e.g., **RockYou.txt**).

### **c. Hybrid Attack**

* Combines **dictionary and brute force** techniques.
* Example: Adding numbers to the end of dictionary words — “password123”.

### **d. Rainbow Table Attack**

* Uses **precomputed hash tables** to crack hashes quickly.
* If the hash exists in the rainbow table, password is found instantly.
* Defeated by **salting**, which makes each hash unique.

### **e. Phishing and Social Engineering**

* Tricks users into revealing passwords.
* Not technically “cracking”, but achieves the same result.

### **f. Shoulder Surfing and Keylogging**

* Physically or digitally observes password entry.
* Keyloggers record every keystroke, capturing passwords as users type.

### **g. Guessing**

* Manual attempt based on user’s personal information (e.g., birthday, pet name).
* Often effective against weak or default passwords.

## **5. Password Cracking Tools**

| Tool                | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **John the Ripper** | Fast password cracker supporting various hash types.                    |
| **Hashcat**         | Advanced GPU-accelerated password recovery tool.                        |
| **Cain & Abel**     | Windows-based tool for recovering various password types.               |
| **Hydra**           | Network login cracker supporting numerous protocols (SSH, FTP, HTTP).   |
| **OphCrack**        | Uses rainbow tables to crack Windows passwords.                         |

## **6. Defenses Against Password Cracking**

| Defense Mechanism                   | Explanation                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strong Password Policies**        | Require long, complex passwords with a mix of characters.                         |
| **Account Lockouts**                | Lock user account after several failed login attempts.                            |
| **Salting Passwords**               | Add random values to passwords before hashing to make rainbow tables ineffective. |
| **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** | Adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords.                                 |
| **Password Hashing Algorithms**     | Use strong algorithms like bcrypt or scrypt for secure storage.                   |
| **Monitoring and Alerts**           | Detect unusual login attempts or brute force activities.                          |
| **Limit Login Attempts**            | Restrict login trials from specific IPs or time windows.                          |

## **7. Advantages and Disadvantages (in Ethical Hacking Context)**

| Advantages                                      | Disadvantages                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Helps in discovering weak or default passwords. | Time-consuming for complex passwords.             |
| Exposes poor password practices and policies.   | Can cause account lockouts if not done carefully. |
| Aids in strengthening system authentication.    | Misuse by attackers leads to data breaches.       |

## **8. Real-World Examples**

* **LinkedIn Data Breach (2012)**: Over 117 million passwords leaked — most were **easily cracked** due to poor hashing (SHA-1 without salt).
* **Yahoo Breach (2013–2014)**: 3 billion accounts compromised; attackers used **hashed password dumps** to gain access.
* **RockYou Leak**: A widely used password list (32 million) originated from a poorly secured database.

---

## **9. Best Practices for Password Security**

* Use password managers to create and store strong, unique passwords.
* Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.
* Update passwords regularly.
* Educate users about phishing and social engineering threats.
* Always hash and salt passwords when storing them.

## **10. Conclusion**

Password Cracking is both a **threat and a diagnostic tool** — while attackers use it to compromise systems, ethical hackers use it to strengthen password policies and secure user accounts. As password-based authentication remains widespread, it is essential to understand and guard against these cracking techniques. Organizations should implement robust security mechanisms and educate users on best practices to defend against password-related breaches.
