        <h3>Displays</h3>
        <p>In compiler design, particularly in the runtime environment, a display is a data structure used to efficiently access non-local variables in block-structured programming languages such as Pascal, Ada, and older versions of Algol.

When a language supports nested functions or procedures, a subprogram can access variables declared in its enclosing scopes. The display technique is one approach to managing these non-local variable references.
</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Why Do We Need Displays?</h4>
        <p>In nested procedures, a function can refer to variables not declared in its own scope but in some outer (enclosing) scope. For example:

<pre>procedure A;
  var x: integer;
  procedure B;
    procedure C;
    begin
      x := 10;  // C accesses x from A's scope
    end;
  end;
end;</pre>
Here, C accesses x defined in A. A display helps efficiently resolve such references.
</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>What is a Display?</h4>
        <p>A display is essentially an array of pointers (or addresses), where each element points to the activation record of a currently active lexical level (i.e., scope level).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a procedure at level k wants to access a variable at level j (j < k), it can do so by referencing the j-th entry in the display.
</li>
    <li>This is more efficient than following a chain of static links (another technique for non-local access).
</li>
</ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Structure of a Display</h4>
        <p>A display array is maintained at runtime. Each entry in the display corresponds to a lexical nesting level and points to the base of the activation record for the current invocation of that level.
<br>
<strong>Example:</strong></p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Display Index (Level)</th>
        <th>Pointer (Address)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>Global scope activation record</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Activation record of A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Activation record of B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Activation record of C</td>
    </tr>
</table>

        <h4>Working of a Display</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Procedure Call
</strong>
<ul>
    <li>When a procedure at nesting level k is called:
</li>
<li>The current display entry for level k is saved.
</li>
<li>The new activation record for this call is installed at index k.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong> Variable Access
</strong>
<ul><li>If a variable declared at level j is accessed from a deeper level, the variable can be found at:
</li></ul></li>
<p>display[j] + offset_of_variable</p>

<li><strong>Procedure Return</strong>
<ul>
    <li>When the procedure returns:
</li>
The previous display pointer (saved earlier) is restored.

</ul></li>
        </ol>

                <td>Proportional to nesting depth (slower)</td>
                <td>Constant time (faster)</td>

                <td>No central table needed</td>

                <td>Slightly more complex</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Preferred In</td>
                <td>Functional languages (e.g., Scheme, ML)</td>
                <td>Block-structured languages (e.g., Pascal)</td>

        <h4>Applications of Displays</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficient access to non-local variables in languages with lexical scoping and nested procedures.
</li>
            <li>Commonly used in Pascal-style compilers.
</li>
            <li>Helps in optimizing runtime performance by avoiding repeated traversal of static links.
</li>
            <li>Forms part of runtime memory organization strategies in advanced compilers.
</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Limitations / Challenges</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Requires additional data structure (display array).
</li>
            <li>Must carefully manage saving/restoring display pointers during procedure calls and returns.
</li>
            <li>Becomes more complex in presence of coroutines or concurrency.
</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Displays are an efficient mechanism for accessing non-local variables in nested scopes. By maintaining direct pointers to the activation records of enclosing scopes, they allow for constant-time access to variables from outer procedures. While more complex to manage than static links, displays provide faster variable lookup and are ideal for block-structured languages.
