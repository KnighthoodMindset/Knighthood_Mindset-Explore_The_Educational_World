  <h3>Edge Computing Techniques</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>As the world becomes increasingly connected through IoT devices, cameras, sensors, smartphones, and autonomous systems, the volume of data being generated is growing exponentially. Traditional cloud-based systems, where data is sent to a centralized server for processing, are struggling to meet the demands for real-time performance, privacy, and bandwidth efficiency.</p>
  <p>This is where Edge Computing emerges as a game-changing technology. It refers to processing data closer to the location where it is generated, rather than relying on distant cloud servers. In the context of Computer Vision, edge computing means performing image or video analysis locally on the device — whether it’s a surveillance camera, robot, drone, or smart vehicle — without waiting for cloud feedback.</p>
  <p>Edge computing is transforming computer vision applications by enabling fast, secure, and intelligent decision-making at the source. Let's explore this concept, its architecture, key techniques, and its role in real-world applications.</p>

  <h4>What is Edge Computing in Computer Vision?</h4>
  <p>Edge Computing is a distributed computing paradigm where computation and data storage are brought closer to the devices that collect data, instead of depending solely on centralized servers or clouds.</p>
  <p>In computer vision systems, edge computing enables real-time processing of image or video data at or near the data source, reducing latency and ensuring faster response times. This is particularly useful in time-sensitive applications like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Autonomous driving</li>
    <li>Security surveillance</li>
    <li>Industrial robotics</li>
    <li>Real-time object detection in drones</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Core Idea:</h5>
  <blockquote>“Don't send the data to intelligence — bring the intelligence to the data.”</blockquote>

  <h4>Architecture of Edge Vision Systems</h4>
  <p>A typical edge computing system in computer vision consists of the following layers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Sensors / Cameras</b>: Devices that capture visual data (images, videos).</li>
    <li><b>Edge Devices / Edge Nodes</b>: Devices like smartphones, Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, or industrial IoT cameras equipped with CPUs/GPUs/NPUs to process data locally.</li>
    <li><b>Edge AI Models</b>: Pre-trained lightweight neural networks or algorithms optimized to run on edge hardware.</li>
    <li><b>Connectivity Layer</b>: Optional connection to cloud or servers for storage, updates, or additional computation.</li>
    <li><b>User Interface / Actuator</b>: Devices or software that take action based on the processed results.</li>
