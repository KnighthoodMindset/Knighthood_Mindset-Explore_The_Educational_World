  <h3>Active and Passive Sniffing Techniques</h3>
 

  <section>
    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <p>In the realm of network sniffing and ethical hacking, sniffing techniques are broadly categorized into two types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Active Sniffing</li>
      <li>Passive Sniffing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both techniques are used to capture data packets on a network, but they differ significantly in their approach, usage, risk, and detectability.</p>
    <p>Understanding these methods is crucial for ethical hackers to identify how attackers might access sensitive data and how to protect against such attacks.</p>
  </section>

 

  <section>
    <h4>2. What is Sniffing? (Quick Recap)</h4>
    <p>Sniffing is the process of intercepting and analyzing network traffic to extract useful information such as usernames, passwords, emails, session tokens, and more. It is performed using packet sniffers like Wireshark, Tcpdump, or Cain and Abel.</p>
  </section>

 

  <section>
    <h4>3. Passive Sniffing</h4>
  

    <section>
      <h5>Definition</h5>
      <p>Passive sniffing involves listening to and capturing data packets without altering or interfering with the network traffic. It only works in environments where data is freely available to all devices, like networks using hubs.</p>
    </section>

  

    <section>
      <h5>How It Works</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The attacker places their Network Interface Card (NIC) in promiscuous mode.</li>
        <li>The NIC can now capture all packets, even if they are not addressed to it.</li>
        <li>The attacker analyzes the data silently, without sending any data or triggering alerts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

   

    <section>
      <h5>Typical Scenario</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Works on hub-based networks, where all traffic is broadcast to all devices.</li>
        <li>Since the traffic is not directed to a single device, an attacker can easily capture all network communications.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

   

    <section>
      <section>
  <h5>Advantages</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Undetectable:</b> No active packets are sent; very hard to detect.</li>
    <li><b>Safe:</b> No disruption to the network.</li>
    <li><b>Great for reconnaissance:</b> Ideal for gathering sensitive data like login credentials.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Limitations</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Works only in hub-based networks:</b> Modern networks mostly use switches, where traffic is isolated.</li>
    <li><b>Low interactivity:</b> Can only observe data; cannot manipulate or redirect traffic.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

    </section>




  <section>
    <h4>4. Active Sniffing</h4>
  

    <section>
      <h5>Definition</h5>
      <p>Active sniffing involves taking deliberate actions to manipulate or inject packets into a network, especially switched networks, to capture traffic not originally destined for the attacker.</p>
    </section>

  

    <section>
      <h5>How It Works</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Switches create dedicated communication paths for each device.</li>
        <li>To sniff on a switched network, the attacker must send packets that:
          <ul>
            <li>Fool the switch into redirecting traffic.</li>
            <li>Cause the network to broadcast packets like a hub.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </section>

   

    <section>
      <h5>Typical Scenario</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Active sniffing is essential in switched environments, which isolate data streams between devices.</li>
        <li>The attacker performs ARP poisoning to make the switch forward victim packets to them.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

   

    <section>
      <h5>Advantages</h5>
      <ul>
  <li><strong>Works in modern networks:</strong> Can bypass switches and access isolated traffic.</li>
  <li><strong>More control:</strong> Can modify, redirect, or drop packets.</li>
  <li><strong>Enables man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:</strong> Crucial for intercepting encrypted or protected sessions.</li>
</ul>

    </section>

   

    <section>
      <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Detectable:</strong> Can trigger alerts on IDS/IPS or network monitoring tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Risky:</strong> May cause network instability or raise suspicion.</li>
  <li><strong>Illegal if unauthorized:</strong> Can lead to legal consequences if performed without consent.</li>

    <h4>8. Real-World Example: ARP Spoofing for Active Sniffing</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Attacker performs ARP spoofing to mislead the network.</li>
      <li>Victim’s device sends data to the attacker, thinking it's the gateway.</li>
      <li>Attacker captures and optionally modifies data.</li>
      <li>Attacker forwards data to the actual gateway to avoid detection.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This results in a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.</p>
  </section>

 

  <section>
    <h4>9. Countermeasures Against Sniffing</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Use Switches, Not Hubs:</b> Prevent passive sniffing by isolating traffic.</li>
  <li><b>Encrypt Traffic:</b> Use HTTPS, SSL/TLS, VPNs to secure sensitive data.</li>
  <li><b>Enable Port Security:</b> Limit the number of MAC addresses per switch port.</li>
  <li><b>Use Static ARP Entries:</b> Prevent ARP spoofing by hardcoding gateway MAC addresses.</li>
  <li><b>Implement IDS/IPS:</b> Detect and alert on sniffing or suspicious activity.</li>
</ul>

  </section>


  <section>
    <h4>10. Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Understanding active and passive sniffing techniques is critical for ethical hackers, network defenders, and IT professionals. While passive sniffing quietly monitors data, active sniffing goes a step further by interfering with the network to gather data. Both approaches reveal important vulnerabilities in network infrastructure. Ethical hackers must use these techniques responsibly to test systems, uncover flaws, and strengthen overall network security.</p>
