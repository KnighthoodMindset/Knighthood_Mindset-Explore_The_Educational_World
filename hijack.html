# **Session Hijacking**

---

## **1. Introduction**

In the field of cybersecurity and ethical hacking, **Session Hijacking** is a critical and dangerous attack technique where an attacker **takes control of a legitimate session** between two systems. This session typically involves a user and a web server, often authenticated using cookies, tokens, or session IDs.

By hijacking this session, the attacker **gains unauthorized access** to services and data as if they were the legitimate user.

## **2. What is a Session?**

A **session** is a temporary and interactive exchange of information between two or more devices over a network. In web applications, sessions are used to maintain user state and identity after login.

* For example: When you log in to a website, a session is created and maintained using a **session ID** stored in a cookie or URL parameter.

## **3. What is Session Hijacking?**

**Session Hijacking** (also known as **cookie hijacking**) refers to the exploitation of a valid computer session‚Äîmost commonly a web session‚Äîto **gain unauthorized access** to information or services in a computer system.

> **Goal:** Impersonate a legitimate user and access confidential services or data.

## **4. How Session Hijacking Works**

### üîê Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User logs in** to a secure website (e.g., online banking).
2. Server assigns a **session ID** to maintain the session.
3. The session ID is stored in:

   * Cookies
   * URL (query string)
   * Hidden form fields
4. Attacker **steals the session ID** using various techniques.
5. Attacker **injects the session ID** into their own browser.
6. The server thinks the attacker is the legitimate user.
7. Attacker **accesses the account without knowing the password**.

## **5. Techniques Used in Session Hijacking**

| Technique                      | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Session Sidejacking**        | Capturing session cookies via sniffing tools on unsecured networks.      |
| **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** | Injecting scripts to steal session cookies.                              |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**   | Intercepting traffic between client and server to extract session IDs.   |
| **Session Fixation**           | Forcing the user to use a known session ID so the attacker can reuse it. |
| **Brute Forcing Session IDs**  | Guessing or predicting session IDs due to weak session management.       |

---

## **6. Types of Session Hijacking**

### üîπ **Active Session Hijacking**

* The attacker **actively takes over** an ongoing session.
* Often involves MITM attacks or injected commands.

### üîπ **Passive Session Hijacking**

* The attacker only **monitors or eavesdrops** on the session.
* No direct interaction or modification is made.

## **7. Real-Life Example: Sidejacking on Open Wi-Fi**

1. User connects to a public Wi-Fi network and logs into a website (not using HTTPS).
2. Attacker uses a tool like **Firesheep** or **Wireshark** to sniff network traffic.
3. Session cookie is captured and used to hijack the session.
4. Attacker logs into the victim‚Äôs account and takes control.

## **8. Popular Tools for Session Hijacking**

| Tool                                      | Description                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ettercap**                              | Network sniffing and MITM attacks; useful for ARP poisoning.             |
| **Firesheep**                             | Firefox extension that captures unencrypted session cookies.             |
| **Burp Suite**                            | Intercepts and manipulates HTTP requests and sessions.                   |
| **Wireshark**                             | Captures and analyzes packets on a network for sniffing session cookies. |
| **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)** | Leverages browser vulnerabilities to hijack sessions.                    |

## **9. Countermeasures and Prevention**

| Strategy                         | Description                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS)**          | Encrypts all communication, including session cookies.                        |
| **Secure Cookies**               | Set cookies with `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags to protect them.               |
| **Regenerate Session IDs**       | Assign new session ID after login or privilege change.                        |
| **Use Expiry Timers**            | Sessions should expire after inactivity.                                      |
| **User Logout Functions**        | Provide an option to invalidate sessions.                                     |
| **Token Binding or OAuth 2.0**   | Bind sessions to specific devices or IPs.                                     |
| **Implement Session Monitoring** | Alert or block suspicious session reuse or changes in IP/browser fingerprint. |

```
+-------------+      Login      +-------------+    Session ID   +-------------+
|   User PC   | --------------> |   Web Server| --------------> |   Attacker  |
| (Victim)    | <-------------- |             | <-------------- | (Hijacker)  |
+-------------+     Response    +-------------+   Sniff/Steal   +-------------+

Attacker uses stolen session ID to impersonate the user
```

## **12. Ethical Hacking Perspective**

As an ethical hacker or penetration tester, understanding session hijacking is important to:

* **Simulate real-world threats** during security assessments.
* **Evaluate the strength** of session management mechanisms.
* **Test web applications** for XSS, insecure cookies, or weak encryption.
* Help organizations adopt **security best practices**.

---

## **13. Conclusion**

Session Hijacking is one of the most **dangerous and stealthy attacks** in cybersecurity. It allows an attacker to **bypass authentication mechanisms** and directly interact with sensitive data by impersonating a legitimate user. Ethical hackers must fully understand session hijacking techniques and actively test for vulnerabilities in session management to help organizations protect their systems from unauthorized access and data breaches.
