### 📸 **Photo Album – Detailed Explanation**

A **photo album** is a structured digital or physical collection of photographs that are grouped together to preserve and display visual memories. In the context of **computer vision, image processing, and multimedia systems**, the concept of a photo album goes beyond just a simple collection—it becomes an intelligent, searchable, interactive, and even generative repository of visual data.

## 📚 **Definition**

A **photo album** refers to an organized collection of photographs, typically curated to reflect a theme, event, person, or timeline. In modern computing and multimedia environments, photo albums are enhanced with metadata, machine learning, and computer vision techniques to offer features like automatic tagging, face recognition, geolocation, and smart search.

## 🛠️ **Technical Structure in Digital Systems**

In digital photo album applications, each photo is usually associated with a set of attributes:

1. **Image File** – JPEG, PNG, etc.
2. **Metadata** – Time, location (GPS), camera type, ISO, aperture.
3. **Tags** – Descriptive labels like "beach", "birthday", "friends".
4. **Faces/Objects** – Detected using AI algorithms.
5. **Albums/Folders** – The photo is part of one or more albums.

Example (JSON-style structure for a photo):

```json
{
  "filename": "birthday2025.jpg",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-12T15:45:00",
  "location": "Hyderabad, India",
  "tags": ["birthday", "friends", "cake"],
  "faces": ["Sweety", "Ravi"]
}
```
