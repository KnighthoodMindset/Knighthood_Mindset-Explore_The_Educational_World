        <h3>Volumetric Representations</h3>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Volumetric representation is a powerful 3D data modeling technique in computer vision where objects or scenes are described as a volume of space, rather than just points or surfaces. The space is typically divided into small elements called voxels (short for volumetric pixels), which represent a value (like occupancy, density, or color) in a 3D grid. This form of representation is crucial for tasks that require understanding the full spatial extent and internal structure of an object or environment.</p>

        <h4>What is a Volumetric Representation?</h4>
        <p>A volumetric model breaks down 3D space into a grid of equally sized cubes (voxels). Each voxel can hold data such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Occupancy (whether it contains part of an object or not)</li>
            <li>Color or intensity</li>
            <li>Surface normal</li>
            <li>Probability of containing material</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Think of it as a 3D version of a 2D image: while a 2D image has pixels arranged in rows and columns, a volumetric model has voxels arranged in a 3D lattice (width × height × depth).</p>

        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Voxelization</strong>: Converts geometric data (e.g., mesh or point cloud) into a regular voxel grid.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Assignment</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Binary Occupancy Grids: Each voxel is either occupied (1) or empty (0).</li>
                    <li>Signed Distance Functions (SDFs): Store the distance from a voxel to the closest surface (positive for outside, negative for inside).</li>
                    <li>Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF): Used in real-time 3D reconstruction (e.g., KinectFusion).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Storage Optimization</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sparse Voxel Octrees (SVOs): Efficiently store large volumes by dividing only occupied regions recursively.</li>
                    <li>Run-Length Encoding (RLE) or Hash Grids to reduce memory usage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
