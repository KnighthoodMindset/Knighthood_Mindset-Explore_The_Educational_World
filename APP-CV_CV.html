    <li>Intrusion Detection: Cameras detect unauthorized access or unusual activities.</li>
    <li>Crowd Monitoring: Analyzing behavior in public gatherings to identify potential threats.</li>
    <li>License Plate Recognition (LPR): Automatic detection of vehicle plates for traffic regulation and toll collection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These systems enhance security while reducing the need for constant human monitoring.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>4. Retail and Customer Analytics</h4>
  <p>Retailers use computer vision to understand customer behavior and optimize in-store experiences.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer Tracking: Cameras track customer movement to study shopping patterns.</li>
    <li>Smart Checkout: Systems like Amazon Go use cameras to automatically bill customers for what they take, eliminating traditional checkouts.</li>
    <li>Inventory Management: Automatically detecting low-stock shelves or misplaced products.</li>
    <li>Emotion Detection: Analyzing facial expressions to measure customer satisfaction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Computer Vision is helping retailers personalize services, reduce theft, and improve operational efficiency.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>5. Agriculture and Farming</h4>
  <p>In agriculture, computer vision supports precision farming, where technology is used to optimize crop production and monitoring.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crop Health Monitoring: Identifying plant diseases, pest infections, or nutrient deficiencies using drone images.</li>
    <li>Weed Detection: Differentiating between crops and weeds for targeted pesticide spraying.</li>
    <li>Harvest Prediction: Estimating yield based on visual data.</li>
    <li>Livestock Monitoring: Tracking animal behavior and health using camera systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These innovations improve agricultural productivity while minimizing waste and cost.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>6. Manufacturing and Industrial Automation</h4>
  <p>In industries, computer vision is heavily used in quality control, defect detection, and automation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visual Inspection Systems: Detecting cracks, misalignments, or missing parts in manufactured products.</li>
    <li>Sorting and Packaging: Machines can recognize, classify, and sort products in real-time.</li>
    <li>Robotic Arms: Guided by CV, robots perform complex assembly tasks with precision.</li>
