        <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>There are three major types in machine learning</p>
        <h4>1. Supervised Learning:</h4>
        <p>Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct output is already known. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on the labeled data, and it can make predictions on new, unseen data.</p>
        <h5>Regression:</h5>
        <p>Predicting continuous values, such as predicting house prices based on features like number of bedrooms and square footage.</p>
        <h5>Classification:</h5>
        <p>Predicting categorical labels, such as classifying emails as spam or not spam.</p>
        <h4>2. Unsupervised Learning</h4>
        <p>Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, and the model must find patterns or relationships within the data on its own.</p>
        <h5>Clustering:</h5>
        <p>Grouping similar data points together, such as customer segmentation based on buying behavior.</p>
        <h5>Dimensionality reduction:</h5>
        <p>Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information, such as using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.</p>
        <h4>3. Reinforcement Learning</h4>
        <p>Reinforcement learning involves training a model to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The model learns through trial and error, and it receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</p>
        <p><strong>Agent:</strong>The model that takes actions in the environment.</p>
        <p><strong>Environment:</strong>The external world that the agent interacts with.</p>
        <p><strong>Reward:</strong>The feedback signal that the agent receives for its actions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Other types of Machine Learning</h4>
        <p><strong>Semi-supervised learning:</strong> A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the model is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data.</p>
        <p><strong>Self-supervised learning:</strong> The model generates its own labels or supervision signals from the data.</p>
        <p>These types of Machine Learning enable a wide range of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing, and are used in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and more.</p>
