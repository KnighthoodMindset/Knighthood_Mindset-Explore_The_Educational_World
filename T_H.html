## **Types of Hackers**

Hackers are generally classified based on their intent, the legality of their actions, and how they approach their targets. These classifications include:

### **1. White Hat Hackers**

White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, are professionals who use their hacking skills to help organizations identify and fix security vulnerabilities. They operate with legal permission and are often employed by companies to conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Their goal is to improve cybersecurity.

### **2. Black Hat Hackers**

Black hat hackers operate with malicious intent. They gain unauthorized access to systems to steal data, cause damage, or disrupt services. Their activities are illegal and punishable under cybercrime laws. These hackers are responsible for cyberattacks, ransomware, identity theft, and financial frauds.

### **3. Grey Hat Hackers**

Grey hat hackers fall between white and black hats. They may access systems without permission, but they don’t necessarily have malicious intent. For instance, a grey hat may identify a vulnerability and disclose it publicly without exploiting it for personal gain. While their actions can benefit the public, they are still considered illegal due to lack of authorization.

### **4. Script Kiddies**

Script kiddies are amateur hackers who lack technical skills and rely on pre-written scripts or tools developed by others. They usually hack for fun or recognition rather than for profit or political motives. Despite their inexperience, they can still cause damage, especially if they use powerful tools irresponsibly.

### **5. Hacktivists**

Hacktivists use hacking as a form of protest to support political or social causes. They often target government websites, corporations, or media outlets to spread their message. While some view hacktivism as a form of civil disobedience, it is still illegal.

### **6. State-Sponsored Hackers**

These hackers work for government agencies and are involved in cyber-espionage, surveillance, and national defense operations. Their targets are often foreign governments, military systems, or critical infrastructure. Their actions are usually legal in their own country but may be considered hostile by others.
