  <h3>Intermediate Code for Procedures</h3>
  <p>Intermediate code generation is a critical phase in the compiler design process. After parsing and syntax analysis, the next step is to translate the parsed code into an intermediate form, which serves as an abstraction between the high-level source language and the low-level machine code. When dealing with procedures (or functions), the intermediate code generation must handle the procedure calls, parameter passing, local variable allocation, and return mechanisms, which are important for the correct functioning of the program.</p>
  <p>The generation of intermediate code for procedures involves handling the semantics of function calls, returns, parameter passing, and local variables within the function’s scope.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Key Concepts in Intermediate Code for Procedures</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Procedure/Function Call Representation:</strong>
      <p>Procedures or functions in a program can be invoked from other parts of the program, requiring a proper representation of the procedure call and its associated arguments. The intermediate code should handle the mechanics of passing arguments, calling the function, and receiving the return value.</p>
      <p>This is often represented using jump instructions and parameter passing mechanisms in the intermediate code.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Handling Local Variables:</strong>
      <p>Local variables within a procedure are scoped to that procedure, meaning they exist only for the duration of the procedure call. Intermediate code must reflect the allocation and deallocation of memory for local variables, which is typically done through stack frames or activation records.</p>
      <p>The local variables are assigned temporary names or labels in the intermediate code, and memory is reserved for them when the procedure is called.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Parameter Passing:</strong>
      <p>When a procedure is called, arguments are passed to the procedure. There are several methods for parameter passing in intermediate code:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call by Value: The actual value of the argument is passed to the procedure.</li>
        <li>Call by Reference: A reference (address) to the argument is passed, so any changes to the argument inside the function affect the original variable.</li>
        <li>Call by Name: A new instance of the variable is created every time it is used in the procedure.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Return Values:</strong>
      <p>Procedures may return values, which need to be handled in the intermediate code. The return value can be assigned to a temporary variable, or in some cases, the return value may be directly placed in a register or memory location.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Example of Intermediate Code for Procedures</h4>
  <p><strong>Source Code (Pseudo C-like Language)</strong></p>
  <pre><code>int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
    int result;
    result = factorial(5);
}
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Intermediate Code Representation</strong></p>

  <p><strong>1. Procedure Definition (factorial)</strong></p>
  <pre><code>L1:  PROC factorial
L2:  param n
L3:  if n == 0 goto L5
L4:  temp1 = n - 1
L5:  temp2 = factorial(temp1)
L6:  temp3 = n * temp2
L7:  return temp3
L8:  return 1
L9:  endfactorial
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>2. Main Function (main)</strong></p>
  <pre><code>L10: PROC main
L11: param result
L12: result = factorial(5)
L13: endmain
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Parameter Passing:</strong> Lines like L2 and L12 show how arguments are passed using the <code>param</code> keyword.</li>
    <li><strong>Recursive Calls:</strong> Line L4 checks for the base case and L5 performs the recursive call.</li>
    <li><strong>Return Values:</strong> L6 and L7 compute and return the value; L8 handles the base case return.</li>
    <li><strong>End of Procedure:</strong> Denoted by <code>endfactorial</code> and <code>endmain</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Detailed Explanation of Key Concepts</h4>

  <p><strong>1. Procedure Prologue and Epilogue</strong></p>
  <p>In a real-world compiler, prologue and epilogue are important steps in function calls.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prologue:</strong> Saves register states and sets up memory before execution.</li>
    <li><strong>Epilogue:</strong> Restores registers and cleans up after function execution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>2. Handling Recursion</strong></p>
  <p>Recursive procedures like <code>factorial</code> need separate stack frames for each call to store state, ensuring correct handling.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Parameter Passing Mechanisms</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Call by Value:</strong>The actual argument (like `5`) is passed to the procedure.</li>
    <li><strong>Call by Reference:</strong>The address of the variable is passed, so any changes in the procedure directly affect the variable.</li>
    <li><strong>Call by Name:</strong>The argument is treated as an expression that is re-evaluated each time it is used in the procedure.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h4>Applications of Intermediate Code for Procedures</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recursive Function Support:</strong>        Intermediate code helps in generating recursive function calls and handling stack frames that store local variables and function return addresses.
</li>
    <li><strong> Memory Allocation:</strong>       It enables the efficient allocation and deallocation of memory for local variables and parameters within a procedure.
</li>
    <li><strong>Optimization :</strong>       Optimizations such as inline expansion, constant folding, and loop unrollingcan be applied to the intermediate code, especially when dealing with procedures.
</li>
    <li><strong>Code Generation:</strong>        The intermediate code serves as an abstraction layer for generating target machine code. It allows the machine code generator to work with a simplified version of the source program while preserving important details like control flow and data manipulation.
</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Advantages of Using Intermediate Code for Procedures</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modularity:</strong>Procedures are handled separately, making the code easier to manage and understand.
</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong>The intermediate code can be generated for various target machines without needing to write machine-specific code for each procedure.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimization Opportunities:</strong>     Intermediate code for procedures allows the compiler to apply optimizations that improve runtime efficiency, like inlining or tail-call optimizations.
</li>
    <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong>    By using intermediate code, the compiler separates the parsing, optimization, and code generation stages, making it easier to maintain and extend.
</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Limitations</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong>    Handling procedures, especially recursive ones, requires careful management of stack frames and activation records.
</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Management Challenges:</strong>     Intermediate code generation for procedures must ensure proper memory management for function calls, which may require sophisticated techniques for managing stack space.
</li>
    <li><strong>Execution Overhead from Recursive Calls:</strong>   Recursion and function calls can add overhead in terms of both memory (due to activation records) and execution time (due to recursive calls).
</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Intermediate code for procedures plays a vital role in the compilation process by providing a structured, machine-independent representation of procedures and their control flows. It allows the compiler to handle function calls, parameter passing, recursion, and local variable management in a clear and efficient manner, ensuring that the generated code is both correct and optimized for the target machine.</p>
  <p>Understanding how to represent procedures in intermediate code is crucial for building efficient and powerful compilers capable of handling complex language features like recursion and function calls.</p>
