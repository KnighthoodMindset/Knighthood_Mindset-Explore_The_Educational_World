## 🧰 Steganography Tools in Ethical Hacking

---

### 📘 Introduction

**Steganography tools** are specialized software applications that help in **hiding or extracting secret information** within various types of media such as images, audio, video, text files, and network packets. In ethical hacking, knowledge of these tools is vital for:

* Testing systems for covert data channels
* Performing **digital forensics**
* Understanding how data exfiltration or malware can be concealed

These tools can be used both defensively (for training and research) and offensively (by malicious actors). Therefore, ethical hackers must know **how these tools work** to **identify, detect, and mitigate** steganographic threats.
