  <h2>Security and Energy Efficiency</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Security and energy efficiency are two vital aspects of modern computing systems, especially in the context of distributed environments, cloud platforms, and large-scale data centers. As technology advances and systems become more interconnected and complex, ensuring that computing environments are secure from threats while maintaining low power consumption is a top priority for developers, service providers, and organizations.
  </p>

  <h4>1. Security in Computing Systems</h4>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Definition</h5>
  <p>
    Security in computing refers to the protection of systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, damage, or theft. It ensures the CIA triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of information.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Key Objectives of Security</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Confidentiality: Ensuring that data is accessible only to those authorized to access it.</li>
    <li>Integrity: Guaranteeing that data remains unaltered unless modified by authorized users.</li>
    <li>Availability: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when required by authorized users.</li>
    <li>Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or systems.</li>
    <li>Authorization: Determining user permissions and access levels.</li>
    <li>Non-repudiation: Ensuring that an action or transaction cannot later be denied by the parties involved.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Technologies and Measures</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Firewalls: Control incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.</li>
    <li>Encryption: Protects data during transmission and at rest by converting it into unreadable form.</li>
    <li>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitor systems for suspicious activities or policy violations.</li>
    <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requires multiple proofs of identity.</li>
    <li>Access Control Systems: Define and restrict who can access certain resources.</li>
    <li>VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): Provide secure connections over the internet.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Security in Cloud & Distributed Systems</h5>
  <p>
    In distributed and cloud environments, data is shared across multiple nodes and data centers, making security more complex. Providers implement identity and access management, encryption, and secure APIs to ensure data protection.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Common Threats</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Data breaches</li>
    <li>Phishing and social engineering</li>
    <li>DDoS attacks</li>
    <li>Malware and ransomware</li>
    <li>Insider threats</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h4>2. Energy Efficiency in Computing Systems</h4>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Definition</h5>
  <p>
    Energy efficiency in computing means using the least amount of electrical power to perform computing tasks without compromising performance or reliability. It is a key factor in reducing operational costs and the environmental impact of IT infrastructure.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Importance of Energy Efficiency</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduces electricity bills and operating costs</li>
    <li>Increases the lifespan of hardware</li>
    <li>Minimizes carbon footprint</li>
    <li>Essential for battery-powered devices</li>
    <li>Aligns with global sustainability goals</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Strategies to Achieve Energy Efficiency</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Virtualization: Reduces the number of physical machines by running multiple virtual servers on one machine.</li>
    <li>Dynamic Power Management: Powers down unused components automatically.</li>
    <li>Energy-aware Scheduling: Schedules tasks based on energy consumption patterns.</li>
    <li>Efficient Cooling Systems: Uses smart methods to reduce energy used for cooling hardware.</li>
    <li>Load Balancing: Spreads workloads efficiently across systems to avoid overloading.</li>
    <li>Energy-efficient Hardware: Includes low-power CPUs and SSDs that consume less energy.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Green Computing</h5>
  <p>
    A broader approach that promotes eco-friendly computing practices like recycling e-waste, using renewable energy, and designing sustainable systems.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>3. Balancing Security and Energy Efficiency</h4>
  <p>
    Security and energy efficiency often conflict with each other:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-security features like encryption, firewalls, and monitoring tools consume extra processing power, increasing energy use.</li>
    <li>Energy-saving techniques may reduce the availability or monitoring capacity, weakening security.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Solutions include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using lightweight cryptography for low-power devices like IoT.</li>
    <li>Implementing adaptive security, where security levels adjust based on current power availability.</li>
    <li>Designing energy-aware security protocols that conserve power while maintaining acceptable protection levels.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Cloud uses artificial intelligence to optimize energy usage in its data centers while maintaining high security.</li>
    <li>Smartphones use efficient chipsets and background process management to balance app security and battery life.</li>
    <li>IoT devices like smart thermostats implement lightweight encryption to save energy while protecting user data.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    Security and energy efficiency are foundational elements of responsible computing. While security ensures the protection of systems and data from threats, energy efficiency supports cost-effective, environmentally sustainable computing operations. Striking the right balance between the two is essential, especially in cloud computing, edge computing, and mobile environments. As technologies evolve, future systems must integrate smarter solutions to simultaneously achieve both goals.
