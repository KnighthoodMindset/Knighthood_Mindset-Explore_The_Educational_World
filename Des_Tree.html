      <h4>What is a Decision Tree</h4>
      <p>A <strong>Decision Tree</strong> is a way for computers (and humans!) to make decisions step by step, like answering a series of questions. It’s structured like a tree:</p>
      <li>Each <strong>node</strong> is a question or condition</li>
      <li>Each <strong>branch</strong> is the answer or outcome of that question</li>
      <li>The <strong>leaves</strong> (ends) are the final decision or classification</li>

      <h4>How Does It Work</h4>
      <p>Imagine you’re helping someone decide what movie to watch.</p>
      <P>1. Do you want to watch a comedy?</P>
      <p>- Yes → Go to next question</p>
      <p>- No → Skip to action or ask something else</p>
      <p>2. Do you like horror plots?</p>
      <p>- Yes → Recommend a horror comedy</p>
      <p>- No → Recommend a general comedy</p>
      <p>That's a decision tree! Each step narrows down the options based on answers to specific questions.</p>
      <p>In machine learning, decision trees work the same way — but instead of movies, the tree might help:</p>
      <li>Diagnose a disease</li>
      <li>Approve a Loan</li>
      <li>Identify if an email is spam</li>
      <li>Predict if a customer will buy a product</li>
    </section>

      <h4>Structure of a Decision Tree</h4>
      <li><strong>Root Node</strong>: The starting point (first question)</li>
      <li><strong>Decision Nodes</strong>: Internal nodes that ask a question</li>
      <li><strong>Branches</strong>: The possible answers (Yes/No, or categories)</li>
      <li><strong>Leaf Nodes</strong>: Final decisions (outcomes)</li>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Key Features</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Easy to Understand:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2. No need for Data Normalisation:</strong></p>
      <p>Works with Categorical and Numerical Data</p>
      <p>Handles Both Classification and Regression:</p>
      <li>Classification: Is this a cat or a dog?</li>
      <li>Regression: What will be the price of a house?</li>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Real-Life Examples</h4>
      <p>Let’s say you're buying a phone.</p>
      <p><strong>Q1:</strong>Is the price under $500?</p>
      <p>- No → Skip this phone</p>
      <p>- Yes → Ask next question</p>
      <p><strong>Q2:</strong>Does it have 5G?</p>
      <p>- No → Skip </p>
      <p>- Yes → Ask next question</p>
      <p><strong>Q3:</strong>Does it have good reviews?</p>
      <p>- Yes → Buy it</p>
      <p>- No → Don’t buy it</p>
    </section>

      <h4>Where Decision Trees Shine</h4>
      <p>- When decisions depend on multiple conditions</p>
      <p>- When transparency and explainability are important (like in medical or legal applications)</p>
      <p>- In structured data (like rows of data in a spreadsheet)</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <li>Overfitting</li>
      <li>Small changes in data can make big changes in the tree</li>
      <li>Sometimes not as accurate as other models, but easy to understand</li>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Decision Trees are simple yet powerful tools for decision-making and prediction, structured like a flowchart where each internal node represents a question, each branch represents an outcome, and each leaf node gives a final decision. They are easy to understand, require minimal data preprocessing, and can handle both classification and regression tasks across numerical and categorical data. By mimicking human-like step-by-step decision-making, they offer clear interpretability, but they can also overfit the data if not properly controlled. Despite their simplicity, Decision Trees are foundational models that inspire more advanced techniques like Random Forests and Boosted Trees, making them a crucial concept in the field of machine learning.</p>
