      <h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Bootstrapping is a technique used in compiler design where a simple or minimal compiler is used to help develop a more advanced compiler. It is a method of writing a compiler in the same language that it is intended to compile.</p>
      <p>In simpler terms, bootstrapping means building a compiler using the language it is meant to compile.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Why is Bootstrapping Important?</h4>
      <li>To improve the performance of a compiler.</li>
      <li>To enhance portability across different machines.</li>
      <li>To upgrade or self-host a language (compiler written in its own language).</li>
      <li>To eliminate the dependency on external tools or compilers.</li>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>How Bootstrapping Works </h4>
      <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Write a Simple Compiler in Another Language</p>
      <li>Write a basic compiler for Language X in an existing language like <strong>C</strong> or <strong>Assembly</strong>.</li>
      <li>This simple compiler (called a cross-compiler) can compile basic programs written in X.</li>
      <P><strong>Step 2: </strong>Use the Simple Compiler to Build a More Complex Compiler</P>
      <li>Write a better version of the compiler in Language X itself.</li>
      <li>Now compile this improved compiler using the initial basic compiler.</li>
      <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Use the New Compiler to Compile Itself</p>
      <li>This is the true bootstrapping step!</li>
      <li>You now have a compiler for X written in X — and compiled by itself.</li>
    </section>

      <h4>Tools Commonly Used</h4>
      <li><strong>Lex and Yacc: </strong>For developing the front-end.</li>
      <li><strong>Existing Compilers: </strong>Like GCC for initial compilation before self-compiling.</li>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Benefits of Bootstrapping</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Self-sufficiency: </strong>A language becomes capable of maintaining and improving itself.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Portability: </strong>Easier to port the compiler to a new platform.</p>
      <p><strong>3. optimization: </strong>You can continuously improve the compiler using its own features.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Learning: </strong>It’s an educational tool in understanding compiler construction deeply.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <li>Initially writing the first version of the compiler in a different language can be complex.</li>
      <li>Debugging self-hosted compilers can be tricky.</li>
      <li>Maintaining correctness through multiple generations is critical.</li>
    </section>  
    <section>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Bootstrapping is the process of using a simpler compiler to develop a more sophisticated version, ideally written in the same language it is meant to compile. This self-hosting ability makes languages more robust, portable, and maintainable over time.</p>
      <p>It’s like teaching a baby compiler to grow up and eventually write and improve itself!</p>
