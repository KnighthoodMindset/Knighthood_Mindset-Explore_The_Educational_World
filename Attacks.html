        <h3>Attacks in Ethical Hacking</h3>

        <section>
            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
            <p>In the realm of ethical hacking and cybersecurity, an <strong>attack</strong> is any deliberate attempt by a malicious actor (attacker) to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems. Attacks exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, applications, or human factors to gain unauthorized access, steal data, disrupt services, or cause damage.</p>
            <p>Understanding the various types of attacks, their mechanisms, and impacts is essential for ethical hackers to effectively identify, analyze, and defend against them.</p>

            <h4>2. Classification of Attacks</h4>
            <p>Attacks can be broadly classified based on various factors such as the attacker’s goal, method of execution, and the target system. The common classifications include:</p>

            <h5>a. <strong>Passive Attacks</strong></h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Attacks in which the attacker intercepts or monitors data without altering it.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal</strong>: To gather information covertly without detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Eavesdropping</strong>: Listening to network traffic to capture sensitive data like passwords.</li>
                        <li><strong>Traffic Analysis</strong>: Analyzing communication patterns to infer information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Impact</strong>: Loss of confidentiality; data is exposed but not modified.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>b. <strong>Active Attacks</strong></h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Attacks involving alteration, destruction, or disruption of data or services.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal</strong>: To disrupt normal operations, corrupt data, or gain unauthorized control.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong>: Overloading systems to make them unavailable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Modification</strong>: Changing data in transit or storage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Masquerading</strong>: Pretending to be a legitimate user.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Impact</strong>: Loss of integrity, availability, and possibly confidentiality.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

       

        <section>
            <h4>3. Types of Attacks</h4>

            <h5>a. Reconnaissance Attacks</h5>
            <p>Initial phase of an attack where the attacker gathers information about the target. Techniques include network scanning, footprinting, and social engineering. Helps attackers identify vulnerabilities.</p>

            <h5>b. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</h5>
            <p><strong>DoS</strong>: Attack aims to make a system or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it.</p>
            <p><strong>DDoS</strong>: Multiple compromised systems attack a target simultaneously. Effects include service downtime and loss of business.</p>

            <h5>c. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h5>
            <p>Attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. Common in unsecured Wi-Fi networks. Can lead to data theft, session hijacking.</p>

            <h5>d. Phishing and Spear Phishing</h5>
            <p>Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity. Spear phishing targets specific individuals or organizations.</p>

            <h5>e. SQL Injection</h5>
            <p>Injection of malicious SQL code into an application’s input fields to manipulate databases. Can lead to data leakage, unauthorized access, or database corruption.</p>

            <h5>f. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h5>
            <p>Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Can steal cookies, hijack sessions, or redirect users.</p>

            <h5>g. Password Attacks</h5>
            <p>Methods to obtain user passwords include brute force, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks. Compromise user accounts and access control.</p>

            <h5>h. Malware Attacks</h5>
            <p>Use of malicious software such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Can steal data, encrypt files, or gain control over systems.</p>

            <h5>i. Privilege Escalation Attacks</h5>
            <p>Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher access rights than authorized. Enables attackers to control systems or access sensitive data.</p>
