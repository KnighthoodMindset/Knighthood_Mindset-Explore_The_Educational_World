    <h3>Error Recovery in LR Parsing</h3>
    <p>Error recovery is an essential part of LR parsing, as it helps the parser to continue parsing after encountering a syntax error. LR parsers are one of the most powerful types of bottom-up parsers, capable of handling a large class of grammars. However, like any parser, LR parsers are not immune to errors, and when they encounter a syntax error, they must have a strategy for recovering from it to continue parsing the rest of the input.</p>

  <section>
    <h4>The Need for Error Recovery</h4>
    <p>When an LR parser encounters a sequence of symbols that does not conform to the grammar, it must stop and report the error. However, stopping the parser entirely is not ideal in many cases, especially in large programs. Ideally, the parser should be able to recover from the error, continue processing the rest of the input, and possibly identify more errors, which could then be reported to the user for correction.</p>
    <p>Error recovery ensures that the parser:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resumes parsing after encountering a mistake.</li>
      <li>Identifies further errors.</li>
      <li>Reports multiple errors at once, improving the user experience.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h4>Challenges in Error Recovery for LR Parsers</h4>
    <p>LR parsers are bottom-up parsers, which means that they try to reduce the input string to the start symbol of the grammar. This makes error recovery challenging due to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Shift-Reduce Conflicts:</strong> The parser might get stuck deciding whether to shift or reduce.</li>
      <li><strong>Large Lookahead:</strong> The parser may need to backtrack to choose the correct rule.</li>
      <li><strong>Incorrect Parsing State:</strong> Errors can place the parser in invalid states, making recovery complex.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Error Recovery Techniques for LR Parsers</h4>

    <h5>1. Panic Mode Recovery</h5>
    <p>The simplest and most common strategy. The parser skips input symbols until it reaches a known synchronization token (like <code>;</code> or <code>}</code>).</p>
    <pre><code>if (x < 10) {
    if (y > 20)</code></pre>
    <p>The parser might discard tokens until it finds <code>}</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple to implement.</li>
      <li>Efficient for large errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>May discard too much input.</li>
      <li>Can miss other nearby errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>2. Phrase-Level Recovery</h5>
    <p>Attempts minimal corrections (insert, delete, or replace tokens) at the point of error.</p>
    <pre><code>if (x < 10 {
    statement;
}</code></pre>
    <p>The parser might insert a missing <code>)</code> after <code>10</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Targeted and preserves context.</p>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Harder to implement and can guess incorrectly.</p>

    <h5>3. Error Productions</h5>
    <p>Grammar rules include special <code>error</code> productions to match invalid input patterns.</p>
    <pre><code>S → if E then S else S
S → error</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Handles known patterns, simplifies recovery.</p>
    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> May overgeneralize and accept incorrect constructs.</p>

    <h4>Advantages and Challenges of Error Recovery in LR Parsing</h4>
    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved robustness.</li>
      <li>Multiple error detection.</li>
      <li>Efficiency in large codebases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implementation complexity.</li>
      <li>Possible loss of parsing context.</li>
      <li>Performance overhead.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  

  <section>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Error recovery in LR parsing is essential for building reliable parsers and compilers. Techniques like panic mode, phrase-level correction, and error productions each offer different trade-offs between complexity and effectiveness. Implementing robust error recovery ensures better user experience, especially in tools like compilers, interpreters, and IDEs.</p>
