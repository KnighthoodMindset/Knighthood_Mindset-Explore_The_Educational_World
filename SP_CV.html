        <h3>Speed Problem</h3>
    </section>


    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>The Speed Problem in computer vision refers to the computational challenge of processing high volumes of visual data efficiently and in real time. As computer vision systems are increasingly deployed in real-world, time-sensitive applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, robotics, and AR/VR, the speed at which images or video frames are processed becomes critically important. Even highly accurate algorithms are impractical if they cannot deliver results within the required time window.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <p>At the core of the speed problem is the high dimensionality and complexity of visual data. Each image contains millions of pixels, and operations like edge detection, segmentation, object recognition, and tracking involve heavy mathematical computations, often across multiple frames per second.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time face detection on a mobile phone must complete in milliseconds.</li>
      <li>Autonomous driving systems must detect obstacles, lanes, and traffic signs continuously without delay.</li>
      <li>Video analytics for surveillance may involve processing hundreds of frames per second across multiple cameras.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The pipeline for computer vision typically involves:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Image Acquisition</li>
      <li>Pre-processing</li>
      <li>Feature Extraction</li>
      <li>Detection/Classification</li>
      <li>Post-processing</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each of these steps can become a bottleneck if not optimized.</p>
  </section>

    <h4>Key Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High Computational Cost</strong>: Algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require millions of operations per frame. GPUs help, but they are power-hungry and costly.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory Bottlenecks</strong>: Intermediate results like feature maps, masks, etc., consume memory bandwidth and slow down processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Latency Sensitivity</strong>: In applications like self-driving cars, even a 100 ms delay can cause catastrophic results.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy Constraints</strong>: On mobile or embedded systems, speed must be achieved with limited energy resources.</li>
      <li><strong>High Frame Rate Requirements</strong>: Real-time systems may need to process 30-120 FPS. At 60 FPS, each frame must be handled in &lt;16 milliseconds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>1. Model Optimization</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Pruning: Removing unnecessary weights in deep learning models.</li>
      <li>Quantization: Using lower precision (e.g., INT8 instead of FP32).</li>
      <li>Knowledge Distillation: Training smaller models to mimic larger ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>2. Hardware Acceleration</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Use of GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, or edge AI chips.</li>
      <li>Parallel processing techniques using CUDA or OpenCL.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>3. Algorithmic Improvements</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Use faster alternatives: YOLO instead of R-CNN.</li>
      <li>Efficient algorithms: SIFT → ORB, ResNet → MobileNet, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>4. Region of Interest (ROI) Processing</h5>
    <p>Instead of analyzing the whole image, process only important regions to reduce computation.</p>

    <h5>5. Frame Skipping &amp; Pipelining</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Process fewer frames intelligently.</li>
      <li>Use pipelined architecture to overlap computations.</li>
    </ul>
