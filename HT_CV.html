        <h3>Hough Transformation(HT) for line detection</h3>
    </section>

<section>
  

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>The Hough Transform is a popular algorithm used in image analysis and computer vision to detect simple geometric shapes, primarily lines, circles, and ellipses, within images. Originally proposed by Paul Hough in 1962, it gained immense popularity for line detection due to its robustness against noise and its ability to detect incomplete or broken lines.</p>
  <p>When direct edge detection isn't enough due to noise or discontinuities, the Hough Transform provides a way to detect lines even when parts of the line are missing. It works by transforming points in image space into a parameter space, where lines can be identified by accumulation of votes.</p>

  <h4>Basic Idea</h4>
  <p>A line in Cartesian form is:</p>
  <pre>y = mx + c</pre>
  <p>But this becomes problematic for vertical lines (where slope m → ∞). So, Hough Transform uses the polar representation of a line:</p>
  <pre>ρ = x·cos(θ) + y·sin(θ)</pre>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ρ (rho) is the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line.</li>
    <li>θ (theta) is the angle between the x-axis and the perpendicular to the line.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each point (x, y) in the image space corresponds to a sinusoidal curve in Hough (parameter) space. If multiple points in the image lie on the same line, their curves will intersect at a common point (ρ, θ) in parameter space.</p>

  <h4>Working Steps of Hough Transform for Line Detection</h4>

  <h5>1. Preprocessing</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Convert the image to grayscale.</li>
    <li>Apply edge detection (e.g., Canny Edge Detector) to get binary edges.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>2. Hough Space Initialization</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Initialize a 2D accumulator array A(ρ, θ) to hold "votes" for line parameters.</li>
    <li>ρ is quantized from –D to +D where D = √(width² + height²), the maximum possible distance from the origin.</li>
    <li>θ ranges typically from 0° to 180° or –90° to 90°.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>3. Voting in Parameter Space</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>For each edge point (x, y) in the image:
      <ul>
        <li>Loop over θ (e.g., 0° to 180° in 1° steps).</li>
        <li>Compute ρ = x·cos(θ) + y·sin(θ).</li>
        <li>Increment A(ρ, θ) in the accumulator.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>4. Finding Peaks</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>After all edge points vote:
      <ul>
        <li>The accumulator contains peaks where many edge points agree on a (ρ, θ) — representing potential lines.</li>
        <li>Apply a threshold to detect significant peaks.</li>
        <li>Each peak corresponds to a line in the image.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>5. Mapping Back</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Convert the parameters (ρ, θ) back into a line in image space using:</li>
  </ul>
  <pre>x·cos(θ) + y·sin(θ) = ρ</pre>
  <p>Draw or highlight the detected line segments.</p>

  <h4>Visualization Example</h4>
  <p>Let’s assume a point P(10, 20):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For various angles θ, we compute ρ using ρ = x·cos(θ) + y·sin(θ).</li>
    <li>Each (ρ, θ) is plotted in accumulator space.</li>
    <li>If multiple edge points (like P1, P2, P3) lie on the same line, their curves intersect at the same (ρ, θ).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Applications</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Lane Detection in autonomous vehicles.</li>
    <li>Document Layout Analysis: Detecting text lines, tables, etc.</li>
    <li>Medical Imaging: Detecting bone fractures or vessel paths.</li>
    <li>Shape Recognition: Finding boundaries of regular objects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Advantages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Robust to Noise: Works well even if lines are partially broken or noisy.</li>
    <li>Detects Multiple Lines: Can detect many lines at once.</li>
    <li>Parameter Invariance: Works well regardless of image rotation or translation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Limitations</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Computationally Expensive: Needs large accumulator arrays for high-resolution images.</li>
    <li>Quantization Errors: Accuracy depends on how finely ρ and θ are sampled.</li>
    <li>Limited to Simple Shapes: Basic Hough Transform detects only straight lines; circles/ellipses require modified versions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>The Hough Transform for line detection is a powerful tool in the arsenal of computer vision techniques. By transforming the problem of finding a global pattern (a line) in a cluttered space into a voting problem in parameter space, it offers a clever and robust approach. Though computationally intensive, its ability to detect lines in noisy or broken-edge images makes it highly valuable for practical applications in robotics, autonomous driving, medical analysis, and document processing.</p>
