Here is a **detailed and comprehensive explanation** for the topic **“Steganography Methods and Attacks”** under **Ethical Hacking – Unit 3** for your **Tech Nexus** website:

## 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography Methods and Attacks

---

### 📘 **Introduction to Steganography**

**Steganography** is the practice of concealing a secret message within another, seemingly harmless file or message. The goal is **not to attract attention** to the existence of hidden information.

* **Derived from** the Greek words *“steganos”* (covered) and *“graphia”* (writing).
* **Used in cybersecurity and ethical hacking** to understand how data can be hidden and how to detect such activities.

---

## 📌 Steganography Methods

Steganography techniques can be classified based on the **media** used and **technical approach** adopted.

### 🔹 1. **Text Steganography**

Hiding data within text files using:

* **Format-based methods** – modifying layout, spacing, or fonts.
* **Random and statistical generation** – generating random-looking text where actual info is encoded.
* **Linguistic methods** – using syntactic and semantic manipulation of text.

🧪 **Example:**

```plaintext
Every First Letter of This Sentence Encodes Hidden Meaning.
```

Message: **EFLOTSEHM**

---

### 🔹 2. **Image Steganography**

The most common method. Information is hidden in **image pixels**, especially in the **Least Significant Bits (LSB)**.

#### Methods:

* **LSB Insertion** – Altering the least significant bit of pixel values.
* **Palette-based hiding** – Using the color palette index to store bits.
* **DCT-based hiding** – Used in JPEGs to hide data in frequency components.

🧪 **Example:**
In a pixel (10110100), changing the LSB to ‘1’ results in (10110101) – barely detectable.

---

### 🔹 3. **Audio Steganography**

Hides data in **audio files (MP3, WAV)**. Techniques include:

* **LSB coding** – Modifying least significant bits of audio samples.
* **Echo hiding** – Embedding data by introducing echoes at specific intervals.
* **Phase coding** – Changing the phase of audio signal frequencies.

🧪 **Application:** Hiding a message in a song audio file.

---

### 🔹 4. **Video Steganography**

Uses video frames to embed data, combining image and audio steganography.

#### Methods:

* **LSB in frames**
* **Motion vector manipulation**
* **Frame duplication or drop technique**

🧪 **Example:** Hiding a message across different frames in an MP4 video.

---

### 🔹 5. **Network Steganography**

Hides data within **network protocols** (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS).

#### Techniques:

* Hiding data in **packet headers**
* Embedding data in **timing** or **size** of packets
* Using unused or optional fields in protocols

🧪 **Example:** Hiding a payload in TCP sequence numbers.

---

### 🔹 6. **Metadata Steganography**

Hiding information in the **metadata** of files (like image EXIF data, document properties).

🧪 **Example:** Adding a secret message in the author field of a Word document.

---

## 💣 Steganographic Attacks (Steganalysis)

**Steganalysis** is the process of **detecting, extracting, or destroying** steganographic content. Ethical hackers perform such analysis to **uncover hidden threats**.

---

### 🔹 1. **Visual Attacks**

Used against **image/video steganography**. Human inspection or software is used to detect unusual pixels or distortions.

* **Noise pattern analysis**
* **Histogram analysis**
* **Color channel manipulation**

🧪 Detecting repetitive patterns in images that indicate hidden data.

---

### 🔹 2. **Statistical Attacks**

Analyzes statistical anomalies in file structures and content.

* **Chi-square analysis**
* **Entropy measurement**
* **Compression ratio comparison**

🧪 Example: A sudden change in file entropy may indicate embedded data.

---

### 🔹 3. **Signature-based Attacks**

Certain steganography tools leave **signatures** in the file. Tools like **StegDetect** scan files for these fingerprints.

🧪 Detecting a file altered by OpenStego or LSB tools.

---

### 🔹 4. **Structural Attacks**

Focuses on **file format inconsistencies** introduced during embedding.

🧪 Identifying an extra or unusual metadata chunk in a PNG image.

---

### 🔹 5. **Brute Force Attacks**

If the method/tool used is unknown, attackers may use brute force to:

* Attempt different tools and methods
* Try all possible passwords (if encryption is used)

---

### 🔹 6. **Machine Learning-Based Attacks**

Modern steganalysis uses **ML algorithms** to classify files as clean or stego.

* Trained on datasets of stego and normal files
* Detect subtle patterns unnoticeable by humans
