        <h3>Spatial Matched Filtering</h3>
    </section>

<section>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Spatial matched filtering is a signal and image processing technique used to detect known patterns or features within an image by enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is based on correlation theory and is designed to maximize the response of the filter when a known template (object or pattern) is present in the input image.</p>
  <p>In computer vision, matched filtering is widely used in template matching, object detection, face recognition, biometrics, and even medical image analysis, especially when the object of interest has a known shape or pattern.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>How It Works</h4>
  <p>Matched filtering operates by sliding a known template or kernel over an input image and computing the correlation (or dot product) at each position. The highest correlation value indicates the best match — suggesting the likely presence and location of the desired object.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h5>Mathematical Principle</h5>
  <p>If:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>f(x, y)</code> is the input image, and</li>
    <li><code>h(x, y)</code> is the known template or filter (i.e., the target signal),</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then the matched filter output <code>g(x, y)</code> is given by:</p>
  <p><code>g(x, y) = ∑<sub>u</sub> ∑<sub>v</sub> f(x+u, y+v) · h(u, v)</code></p>
  <p>This is equivalent to convolving the image with the flipped version of the template.</p>
  <p>In other words, matched filtering is like cross-correlation: you're checking how closely a part of the image matches a known shape.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Template: A small image or pattern representing the object to be detected.</li>
    <li>Correlation: Measures similarity between image patch and template.</li>
    <li>Spatial Domain: Filtering is performed directly on pixel values (unlike frequency-domain filtering via Fourier Transform).</li>
    <li>SNR Maximization: The matched filter is optimal in terms of maximizing signal-to-noise ratio when noise is additive white Gaussian.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Applications</h4>
  <h5>1. Template Matching</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Used to find predefined shapes or objects (e.g., faces, logos, eyes).</li>
    <li>Applied in real-time face detection systems and tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>2. Medical Imaging</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Detecting specific biological shapes (e.g., tumors, blood vessels, retinas) using pre-defined filters.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>3. License Plate or Object Recognition</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Filters can be trained or crafted to detect alphanumeric shapes or car models.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>4. Biometric Systems</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Fingerprint and iris matching using matched templates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Advantages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Optimal SNR: Theoretically provides the best response under Gaussian noise.</li>
    <li>Easy to Implement: Requires only basic convolution or correlation.</li>
    <li>Scalable: Can be applied to varying template sizes or image resolutions.</li>
    <li>Deterministic: Produces reproducible results with no randomness.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Limitations</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Sensitive to Scale and Rotation: A matched filter for one size or orientation won’t work for others.</li>
    <li>Not Robust to Occlusion: If the object is partially hidden, performance degrades.</li>
    <li>Computationally Expensive: For large templates or high-resolution images, the correlation at every point is costly.</li>
    <li>Fixed Template Dependency: Requires prior knowledge of the exact shape of the object to detect.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Comparison with Convolution Filters</h4>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Matched Filtering</th>
      <th>Convolution</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Uses a known template</td>
      <td>Uses generic filters (e.g., edge detection)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Designed for detection</td>
      <td>Often used for enhancement</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sensitive to exact pattern</td>
      <td>More general purpose</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Spatial matched filtering is a powerful and intuitive approach to object detection in computer vision when the object’s shape or appearance is already known. Though limited by scale and orientation sensitivity, its ability to enhance pattern detection in noisy environments makes it a cornerstone technique, especially in constrained and controlled settings. When combined with multi-scale analysis or advanced preprocessing, matched filters can deliver precise and efficient object recognition capabilities.</p>
