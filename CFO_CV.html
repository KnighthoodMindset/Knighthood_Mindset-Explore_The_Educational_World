  <h3>Classical Filtering Operations</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>In the realm of image processing and computer vision, filtering is one of the most fundamental and indispensable operations. Filtering is used to modify or enhance the visual content of an image, primarily by altering pixel values based on the values of their neighboring pixels. Classical filtering operations — the earliest and most widely used forms of filtering — form the backbone of image enhancement, noise reduction, edge detection, and many other preprocessing tasks.</p>
  <p>The term “classical” refers to linear and non-linear filters developed long before the emergence of modern deep learning techniques. Despite their simplicity, these filters continue to play a vital role in preparing images for higher-level computer vision tasks.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Purpose of Filtering</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To remove noise from images</li>
    <li>To highlight or enhance specific features (like edges, corners, textures)</li>
    <li>To smooth images for aesthetic or analysis purposes</li>
    <li>To sharpen blurry images</li>
    <li>To detect patterns such as lines or boundaries</li>
    <li>To simulate human visual perception in digital systems</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Filtering is done using a small matrix known as a kernel or filter mask, which is convolved across the image to modify each pixel value based on its surroundings.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>1. Mean Filter (Averaging Filter)</h4>
  <p>The mean filter is the simplest and most intuitive form of linear filter. It works by taking the average of all the pixels in a defined neighborhood (usually a 3×3 or 5×5 grid) and replacing the central pixel with this average.</p>
  <h5>Purpose:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Noise reduction</li>
    <li>Image smoothing</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Formula:</h5>
  <p>Let <code>I(x, y)</code> be the intensity at position (x, y). The new value is calculated as the mean of neighboring pixels:</p>
  <pre>
I'(x, y) = (1/N) Σ I(x+i, y+j)
  </pre>
  <p>Where N is the number of pixels in the kernel.</p>
  <h5>Advantage:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple to implement</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Disadvantage:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Blurs edges</li>
    <li>Reduces image sharpness</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>2. Gaussian Filter</h4>
  <p>The Gaussian filter is an improvement over the mean filter. Instead of treating all neighboring pixels equally, it assigns higher weights to pixels closer to the center of the kernel. This mimics the way light diffuses and is more natural.</p>
  <h5>Formula:</h5>
  <pre>
G(x, y) = (1/2πσ²) * e^(-(x² + y²)/2σ²)
  </pre>
  <p>Here, σ controls the spread (blurriness) of the filter.</p>
  <h5>Advantages:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Smooths noise while preserving image structure</li>
    <li>Used in edge detection (like the Canny edge detector)</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Slightly more computationally expensive</li>
    <li>Still causes some blurring</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>3. Median Filter</h4>
  <p>Unlike the mean filter, the median filter is non-linear. It replaces each pixel value with the median of neighboring pixels rather than the average. This makes it very effective for removing salt-and-pepper noise (random black and white dots).</p>
  <h5>Steps:</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Collect the neighboring pixel values</li>
    <li>Sort them</li>
    <li>Replace the center pixel with the median</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Advantages:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Preserves edges better than mean filter</li>
    <li>Excellent for impulse noise</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Slightly slower than mean filter</li>
    <li>Less effective for Gaussian noise</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>4. Laplacian Filter</h4>
  <p>The Laplacian filter is a second-order derivative filter used primarily for edge detection. It highlights areas of rapid intensity change.</p>
  <h5>Kernel Example:</h5>
  <pre>
[ 0 -1  0 ]
[-1  4 -1]
[ 0 -1  0 ]
  </pre>
  <h5>Applications:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Used to sharpen images</li>
    <li>Highlights boundaries</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Highly sensitive to noise</li>
    <li>Often used in combination with Gaussian smoothing</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>5. Sobel and Prewitt Filters</h4>
  <p>These are first-order derivative filters used to compute image gradients in the horizontal and vertical directions. They are fundamental in edge detection and feature extraction.</p>
  <h5>Sobel Filter:</h5>
  <p>Horizontal Kernel:</p>
  <pre>
[ -1  0  1 ]
[ -2  0  2 ]
[ -1  0  1 ]
  </pre>
  <p>Vertical Kernel:</p>
  <pre>
[ -1 -2 -1 ]
[  0  0  0 ]
[  1  2  1 ]
  </pre>
  <h5>Applications:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Edge detection in x and y directions</li>
    <li>Emphasizes borders</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Advantages:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Robust to noise due to smoothing effect</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Limitations:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Not rotation invariant</li>
    <li>Can miss diagonal edges</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>6. Bilateral Filter</h4>
  <p>The bilateral filter is a non-linear technique that smooths images while preserving edges — something that traditional filters struggle with. It considers both spatial distance and intensity difference when computing the new pixel value.</p>
  <h5>Advantages:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Keeps edges sharp</li>
    <li>Reduces noise effectively</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Computationally expensive</li>
    <li>Not suitable for real-time applications without optimization</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>7. High-Pass and Low-Pass Filtering</h4>
  <p>These filters are based on frequency domain analysis.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Low-Pass Filters</b> allow low-frequency components (smooth areas) and suppress high-frequency noise. Used for blurring.</li>
    <li><b>High-Pass Filters</b> emphasize high-frequency components such as edges and fine details. Used for sharpening.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are used in combination for various enhancement and detection tasks.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>How Filtering Works: Convolution</h4>
  <p>All linear filters operate using a mathematical process called convolution. This involves sliding the kernel over the image, multiplying each kernel value with the corresponding image pixel, and summing the results.</p>
  <pre>
Output(x, y) = Σ K(i,j) * I(x-i, y-j)
  </pre>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>K(i,j)</code> is the kernel</li>
    <li><code>I(x,y)</code> is the image pixel</li>
    <li><code>Output(x,y)</code> is the filtered result</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This operation is performed for each pixel in the image.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Applications of Classical Filtering</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Denoising medical or satellite images</li>
    <li>Edge enhancement for document scanning</li>
    <li>Preprocessing for facial recognition</li>
    <li>Removing artifacts from old, scanned images</li>
    <li>Detecting motion, corners, and features</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Despite the growth of deep learning, these filters remain reliable, interpretable, and lightweight solutions in many real-world systems.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Classical filtering operations are the bedrock of image preprocessing. They offer powerful yet simple tools for manipulating visual data before it is analyzed by more complex algorithms. Whether it's the mean filter for basic smoothing, the median filter for noise suppression, or the Sobel operator for edge detection — these techniques allow computer vision systems to begin interpreting the visual world intelligently.</p>
  <p>As we advance into neural networks and AI-driven vision models, classical filters remain indispensable for foundational processing, quick analysis, and systems where computational simplicity is a necessity.</p>
