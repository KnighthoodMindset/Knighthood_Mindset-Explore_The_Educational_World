        <h3>Implementing MLPs with Keras</h3>
        <h4>What are Multilayer Perceptrons</h4>
        <p>MLPs are a type of feedforward neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons". They're designed to learn complex patterns in data and can be used for classification and regression tasks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Key Components of MLPs</h4>
        <P><strong>1. Input Layer:</strong>The input layer receives the data that you want to process.</P>
        <p><strong>2. Hidden Layers:</strong> The hidden layers are where the complex processing happens. Each layer consists of multiple neurons that apply different weights and biases to the input data.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Output Layer:</strong>The output layer produces the final result of the processing.</p>

      <h4>Working of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)</h4>
      <p>MLPs work by propagating input data through multiple layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons", allowing the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data</p>
      <p><strong>1. Input Layer:</strong>The input layer receives the data that you want to process</p>
      <p><strong>2. Forward Propagation:</strong>The input data is propagated through the network, layer by layer, with each layer applying weights and biases to the input data</p>
      <p><strong>3. Activation Functions:</strong>Each layer applies an activation function to the output, introducing non-linearity into the model</p>
      <p><strong>4. Hidden Layers:</strong>The hidden layers process the input data, allowing the model to learn complex patterns and relationships</p>
      <p><strong>5. Output Layer:</strong>The output layer produces the final result of the processing</p>
      <p><strong>6. Error Calculation:</strong>The error between the predicted output and the actual output is calculated</p>
      <p><strong>7. Backpropagation:</strong>The error is propagated backwards through the network, allowing the model to adjust the weights and biases to minimize the error</p>
      <p><strong>8. Optimization:</strong>The model is optimized using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), to minimize the loss function</p>

      <h4>Building MLPs with Keras</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Define the Model Architecture:</strong>Define the number of hidden layers, neurons, and activation functions for your MLP model</p>
      <p><strong>2. Compile the Model:</strong>Compile the model with a loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Train the Model:</strong>Train the model on your dataset using Keras' built-in training algorithms</p>
    </section>

      <h4>Advantages of MLPs</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Ability to Learn Complex Patterns:</strong>MLPs can learn complex patterns in data and make accurate predictions.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Flexibility:</strong>MLPs can be used for both classification and regression tasks</p>
      <p><strong>3. Scalability:</strong>MLPs can handle large datasets and complex problems</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Common Activation Functions in MLPs</h4>
      <p><strong>1. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):</strong>A popular activation function that maps all negative values to 0 and all positive values to the same value</p>
      <p><strong>2. Sigmoid:</strong>An activation function that maps values to a probability between 0 and 1</p>
      <p><strong>3. Tanh:</strong>An activation function that maps values to a value between -1 and 1</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Common Optimizers in MLPs</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):</strong>A popular optimizer that updates the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function</p>
      <p><strong>2. Adam:</strong>A popular optimizer that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient</p>
      <p><strong>3. RMSprop:</strong>An optimizer that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient</p>
