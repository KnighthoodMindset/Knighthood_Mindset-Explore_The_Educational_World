        <h3>HT based Circular Object Detection</h3>
    </section>


<section>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Detecting circular objects in images is a critical task in various computer vision applications such as traffic sign recognition, medical imaging (e.g., detecting cells or tumors), industrial inspection (detecting round products or components), and robotics. The Hough Transform (HT) is a powerful feature extraction technique used in image analysis, primarily for detecting shapes like lines, circles, and ellipses. For circular object detection, an extension of the classical Hough Transform, known as the Circular Hough Transform (CHT), is used to detect the presence of circular patterns in a given image regardless of noise or partial occlusion.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>How It Works</h4>
  <p>Circular Hough Transform is based on the parametric equation of a circle in a 2D plane:</p>
  <p>(x - a)<sup>2</sup> + (y - b)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup></p>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(x, y) is a point on the circumference of the circle,</li>
    <li>(a, b) is the center of the circle,</li>
    <li>r is the radius.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The process follows these main steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Edge Detection</b>:<br>
    Initially, an edge detection algorithm like Canny is applied to the input image to highlight edges. This helps in reducing the search space to relevant boundary pixels.</li>
    <li><b>Accumulator Space Voting</b>:<br>
    For each edge pixel (x, y), it is assumed that it lies on the circumference of a potential circle. The algorithm votes for all possible centers (a, b) for different radii r. These votes are stored in a 3D accumulator array indexed by (a, b, r).</li>
    <li><b>Local Maxima Detection</b>:<br>
    Peaks in the accumulator space correspond to circles in the image. These maxima are extracted to determine the location and radius of detected circles.</li>
    <li><b>Post-Processing</b>:<br>
    Duplicate or overlapping circles are filtered, and the results can be overlaid on the original image for visualization.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

  <h4>Key Features and Characteristics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Robust to Noise: Performs well even in noisy images due to its global voting approach.</li>
    <li>Partial Circle Detection: Can detect circles even when the full circumference is not visible.</li>
    <li>Multi-Circle Detection: Capable of detecting multiple circles of different sizes in a single pass.</li>
    <li>Scale Invariance: Detects circles of varying radii, making it adaptable to real-world images.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Applications</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Medical Imaging: Detection of circular tumors, red blood cells, or eye pupils.</li>
    <li>Industrial Automation: Identifying bottle caps, screws, or round parts on assembly lines.</li>
    <li>Traffic Monitoring: Detecting round traffic signs or wheels in self-driving systems.</li>
    <li>Astronomy: Detection of stars or circular astronomical bodies in telescope images.</li>
    <li>Microscopy: Identification of circular structures in microscopic images.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Advantages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Accurate detection of perfect and near-perfect circles.</li>
    <li>Performs well under different lighting and contrast conditions.</li>
    <li>Can detect multiple circles in a single operation.</li>
    <li>Doesn’t require predefined templates or training.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Limitations</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Computationally Intensive: The 3D accumulator space (especially when radius range is large) makes it resource-heavy.</li>
    <li>Parameter Sensitivity: The accuracy depends on correct radius range selection.</li>
    <li>Performance Drop in High Noise: While robust, extremely high noise can cause false detections.</li>
    <li>Limited Shape Flexibility: Only works for circles unless extended (like Generalized Hough Transform for arbitrary shapes).</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>The Hough Transform based Circular Object Detection technique is a foundational approach in computer vision for identifying circular patterns within images. Despite being computationally intensive, it offers high accuracy and robustness for various real-world scenarios. Its ability to detect circles even in challenging conditions makes it valuable in medical diagnostics, industrial quality control, and autonomous systems. Understanding the mechanics of CHT helps in designing more effective and reliable vision systems for circular feature analysis.</p>
