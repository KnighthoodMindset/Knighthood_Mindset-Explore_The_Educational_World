        <h3>Main Approaches for Dimensionality Reduction</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while preserving the most important information. It involves transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to analyze, visualize, and process.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Main Approaches</h4>
        <h5>1. Linear Dimensionality Reduction</h5>
        <p><strong>1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):</strong>PCA is a widely used technique that projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space using orthogonal transformation</p>
        <p><strong>2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):</strong>SVD is a factorization technique that can be used for dimensionality reduction</p>

        <h5>2. Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction</h5>
        <p><strong>1. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):</strong>t-SNE is a non-linear technique that maps high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space while preserving local structure</p>
        <p><strong>2. Autoencoders:</strong>Autoencoders are neural networks that learn to compress and reconstruct data, often used for dimensionality reduction.</p>

        <h5>3. Feature Selection</h5>
        <p><strong>1. Filter Methods:</strong>Filter methods evaluate features based on their relevance and select a subset of features.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Wrapper Methods:</strong> Wrapper methods use a machine learning algorithm to evaluate features and select a subset of features.</p>

        <h5>4. Other Techniques</h5>
        <p><strong>1. Independent Component Analysis (ICA):</strong>ICA is a technique that separates multivariate data into independent components.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Local Linear Embedding (LLE):</strong>LLE is a non-linear technique that preserves local structure in high-dimensional data.</p>
        
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>The choice of dimensionality reduction technique depends on the nature of the data, the goal of the analysis, and the computational resources available</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p><strong>1. Data Visualization:</strong> Dimensionality reduction techniques can be used to visualize high-dimensional data.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Noise Reduction:</strong>Dimensionality reduction techniques can be used to reduce noise in high-dimensional data.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Feature Extraction:</strong>Dimensionality reduction techniques can be used to extract relevant features from high-dimensional data.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>By applying dimensionality reduction techniques, you can simplify complex data, improve model performance, and gain insights into the underlying structure of the data.</p>
