        <h3>Differences Between Compiler and Interpreter</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>A <strong>compiler</strong> is a program that translates the entire source code of a programming language into machine code in one go, producing a separate executable file. It performs extensive error checking and code optimization during compilation. Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Go. Once compiled, the code runs quickly without needing the compiler again, but recompilation is necessary if the code changes or if it’s moved to a different platform.</p>
        <p>An <strong>interpreter</strong>, on the other hand, translates and executes source code line by line. It doesn’t produce a separate machine code file. Interpreters are helpful in environments where real-time execution and debugging are essential, such as in scripting and rapid application development. Examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. Although slower than compiled code, interpreted code is often easier to test and modify.</p>
        <p>ompilers are preferred for performance and deployment, while Interpreters are ideal for flexibility and ease of testing.</p>
