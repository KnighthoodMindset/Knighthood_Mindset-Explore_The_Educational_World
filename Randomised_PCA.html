        <h3>Randomised PCA</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Randomized PCA is a variant of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that uses randomization to improve computational efficiency. It is based on the idea of approximating the principal components of a matrix using random projections</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
        <P><strong>1. Random projection:</strong>A random matrix is used to project the data onto a lower-dimensional space.</P>
        <p><strong>2. Singular value Decomposition:</strong>SVD is computed on the projected data to extract the principal components.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Approximation:</strong>The resulting principal components are an approximation of the true principal components.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Theoretical Foundations</h4>
        <p><strong>1. Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma:</strong>This lemma provides a theoretical foundation for random projections, showing that they can preserve the pairwise distances between points.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Random Matrix Theory:</strong>Random matrix theory provides a framework for understanding the properties of random matrices and their behavior in various applications.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <p><strong>1. Computational Efficiency:</strong>Randomized PCA is faster than traditional PCA for large datasets</p>
        <p><strong>2. Scalability:</strong>Randomized PCA can handle large datasets that do not fit in memory</p>
        <p><strong>3. Flexibility:</strong>Randomized PCA can be used in a variety of applications, including real-time processing and distributed computing.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Limitations</h4>
        <p><strong>1. Approximation Error:</strong>The approximation error of randomized PCA depends on the quality of the random projection and the number of components retained</p>
        <p><strong>2. Choice of Parameters:</strong>The choice of parameters, such as the number of components and the random matrix, can affect the performance of randomized PCA</p>
