        <h3>Internet Connectivity</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Internet Connectivity in IoT refers to the ability of smart devices, sensors, and machines to connect to the internet and exchange data with other systems, servers, and users. It is the fundamental requirement that enables IoT devices to function within a connected environment.</p>
      <p>Without internet connectivity, IoT devices would be isolated, unable to communicate, collaborate, or make intelligent decisions. This connectivity allows for remote access, real-time data transfer, cloud integration, and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication—all of which are essential for the success of an IoT ecosystem.</p>

      <h4>Key Aspects of Internet Connectivity in IoT</h4>
      
      <h5>Types of Connectivity Technologies</h5>
      <p>IoT devices can connect to the internet through wired or wireless methods depending on the environment, device type, and requirements.</p>
      <strong>Wired Connectivity</strong>
      <li>Ethernet</li>
      <li>Power Line Communication</li>
      <strong>Advantages</strong>
      <li>Stable, fast, secure</li>
      <li>Best for industrial or static setups</li>
    </section>
    <section>
      <strong>Limitations</strong>
      <li>Not flexible or mobile</li>
      <li>Expensive infrastructure</li>
      <strong>Wireless Connectivity</strong>
      <li>Wi-Fi</li>
      <li>Bluetooth / BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)</li>
      <li>Zigbee</li>
      <li>Z-Wave</li>
      <lli>LoRaWAN</lli>
      <li>NB-IoT / LTE-M (Cellular LPWAN)</li>
      <li>5G / 4G / 3G</li>
      <li>Satelite</li>
      <strong>Advantages</strong>
      <li>Flexible and scalable</li>
      <li>Ideal for consumer and field-based applications</li>
      <strong>Limitations</strong>
      <li>Susceptible to interference</li>
      <li>May require power optimization</li>

      <h5>2. Connectivity Architecture</h5>
      <p>IoT connectivity involves multiple layers and components:</p>
      <li><strong>Devices: </strong>Sensors, actuators, and smart appliances</li>
      <li><strong>Gateways: </strong>Intermediate nodes that aggregate and send data to the cloud</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Networks: </strong>Wi-Fi, cellular, LoRaWAN, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud services: </strong>Store, process, and visualize data</li>
      <li><strong>User Interfaces: </strong>Mobile apps, dashboards, voice interfaces</li>
      <p>This architecture supports device-to-device, device-to-cloud, and cloud-to-cloud communication.</p>

      <h5>3. Bandwidth and Data Rate</h5>
      <p>Different IoT applications require different data transfer speeds.</p>
      <li><strong>Low-data applications: </strong>Smart meters, temperature sensors → use NB-IoT or LoRaWAN</li>
      <li><strong>High-data applications: </strong>Video surveillance, smart vehicles → use 4G/5G or Wi-Fi.</li>
      <p>Bandwidth optimization is crucial to prevent network congestion and ensure timely data delivery.</p>

      <h5>4. Latency and Response Time</h5>
      <p>Latency is the time taken for a data packet to reach its destination. In real-time systems (e.g., healthcare, automotive), low latency is critical.</p>
      <p>Edge computing and 5G networks help minimize latency by processing data closer to the source.</p>

      <h5>5. Network Coverage and Availability</h5>
      <p>Devices in remote areas must rely on wide-range connectivity like:</p>
      <li>NB-IoT</li>
      <li>LoRaWAN</li>
      <li>Satellite IoT</li>
      <p>Devices in urban or indoor environments may use:</p>
      <li>Wi-Fi</li>
      <li>Zigbee</li>
      <li>BLE</li>
      <p>The right connectivity ensures continuous data transmission without interruptions.</p>
