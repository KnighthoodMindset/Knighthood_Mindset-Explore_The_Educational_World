    <h3>Vulnerability in Ethical Hacking</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a computer system, software, network, or protocol that can be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or cause damage. In the field of ethical hacking, identifying and understanding vulnerabilities is a core objective during vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.</p>
    <p>Vulnerabilities can exist in many forms—software bugs, misconfigurations, outdated software, improper authentication, and more. Recognizing these weak spots allows organizations to patch security gaps before they are exploited maliciously.</p>

  <section>
    <h4>Common Types of Vulnerabilities</h4>

    <h4>1. Buffer Overflow</h4>
    <p>Occurs when data exceeds the buffer storage, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Attacker exploits an overflow in a login buffer to execute malicious shellcode.</p>

    <h4>2. SQL Injection</h4>
    <p>Injection of malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate a database.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>admin' OR '1'='1</code> can bypass login authentication if not sanitized properly.</p>

    <h4>3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h4>
    <p>Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag added to a comment section can steal cookies.</p>

    <h4>4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h4>
    <p>Forces a user to perform unwanted actions on a web app where they are authenticated.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A hidden request changes the user’s email when clicked unknowingly.</p>

    <h4>5. Privilege Escalation</h4>
    <p>An attacker exploits a flaw to gain elevated access to resources that should be unavailable.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Exploiting a misconfigured SUID program to gain root access.</p>

    <h4>6. Broken Authentication</h4>
    <p>Failure to securely manage credentials or sessions, allowing unauthorized access.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Session tokens are not invalidated after logout.</p>

    <h4>7. Directory Traversal</h4>
    <p>Manipulating file paths to access files/directories outside of the web root folder.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using <code>../../etc/passwd</code> to read sensitive files.</p>

    <h4>8. Zero-Day Vulnerability</h4>
    <p>A vulnerability unknown to the software vendor, exploited before a patch is available.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Nation-state hackers exploiting unpatched browser flaws.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>Vulnerability Life Cycle</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Introduction</strong> – The flaw is present due to design or coding errors.</li>
      <li><strong>Discovery</strong> – It is discovered by researchers, hackers, or users.</li>
      <li><strong>Disclosure</strong> – Information is shared publicly or privately with the vendor.</li>
      <li><strong>Exploit Development</strong> – Hackers develop methods to exploit the flaw.</li>
      <li><strong>Patch/Remediation</strong> – Vendors release updates to fix the vulnerability.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigation/Deployment</strong> – Organizations deploy patches or implement workarounds.</li>
    </ol>
