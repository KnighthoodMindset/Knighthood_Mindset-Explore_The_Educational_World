        <h3>Modified OSI Stack for the IOT/M2M Systems</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model was originally developed to standardize the functions of a communication system into seven abstract layers, ranging from the physical transmission of data to the application interfaces used by end-users. While the traditional OSI model has served conventional networking very well, its direct application to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication systems is not always feasible.</p>
      <p>IoT and M2M systems involve a vast range of devices—often small, battery-powered, and resource-constrained—that need to communicate efficiently, securely, and sometimes over low-bandwidth or lossy networks. These challenges demand a modified OSI stack, tailored to the unique characteristics and requirements of IoT/M2M environments.</p>
      <p>In this context, the OSI model is adapted—not abandoned—by substituting or augmenting protocols at each layer to better suit constrained devices, ensure secure communication, and support massive scalability. The result is a lightweight, flexible, and interoperable architecture capable of powering the billions of connected devices that define the modern IoT landscape.</p>

      <p>3. IPv6 Compatibility via Compression: Integrates 6LoWPAN to allow compressed IPv6 communication on small data packets.</p>
      <p>4. Secure and Reliable Communication: Employs encryption methods like DTLS to ensure confidentiality and integrity.</p>
      <p>5. Interoperability: Ensures that devices from different manufacturers can communicate using standardized protocols.</p>
      <p>6. Layered Adaptability: Modifications are made only where needed, allowing developers to reuse existing technologies efficiently.</p>
      <p>7. Cloud and Edge Readiness: Seamlessly connects devices to cloud platforms and supports edge computing for real-time processing.</p>

      <h4>How it works</h4>
      <p>The modified OSI model for IoT/M2M maintains the seven-layer abstraction but integrates specific lightweight technologies and protocols at each layer. Here's how each layer functions in the context of IoT/M2M:</p>
      <h5>1. Physical Layer</h5>
      <li>Deals with the actual transmission of raw bits over physical media.</li>
      <li>In IoT, uses technologies like Zigbee, LoRaWAN, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), NB-IoT, and Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li>Focuses on low power consumption and range efficiency.</li>
      <h5>2. Data Link Layer</h5>
      <li>Ensures reliable transmission between nodes on the same network.</li>
      <li>Incorporates IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, TDMA, or CSMA/CA.</li>
      <li>In many IoT networks, also includes basic encryption and access control mechanisms to protect data at the link level.</li>
      <h5>3. Network Layer</h5>
      <li>Handles addressing and routing of data.</li>
      <li>Uses 6LoWPAN to compress IPv6 headers, making them suitable for small-frame networks.</li>
      <li>Employs routing protocols like RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks).</li>
      <h5>4. Transport Layer</h5>
      <li>Manages reliable or best-effort data delivery.</li>
      <li>TCP is often replaced with UDP to save resources.</li>
      <li>Uses DTLS for encrypted communication over UDP.</li>
      <h5>5. Session layer</h5>
      <li>Manages and controls the dialogue (sessions) between two nodes.</li>
      <li>In constrained devices, this layer is often merged with application or middleware layers, with session handling done by lightweight brokers.</li>
      <h5>6. presentation layer</h5>
      <li>Responsible for data formatting and translation.</li>
      <li>Uses formats like CBOR or JSON, with CBOR preferred for its compactness.</li>
      <li>Supports data abstraction and simplification for interpretation by end-user applications.</li>
      <h5>7. Application layer</h5>
      <li>Offers services and protocols for user interaction.</li>
      <li>Includes lightweight IoT protocols like:</li>
      <p>1. MQTT – Publish/subscribe messaging for low-bandwidth networks.</p>
      <p>2. CoAP – RESTful HTTP-like protocol for constrained devices.</p>
      <p>3. LwM2M – Protocol for device management and service enablement.</p>
      <p>4. HTTP/HTTPS – Still used in high-end IoT devices.</p>
