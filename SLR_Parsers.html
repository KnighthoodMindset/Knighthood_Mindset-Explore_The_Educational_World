    <h3>📘 Construction of SLR Parsing Tables</h3>
    <p>The <strong>SLR(1) parser</strong> (Simple LR parser) relies on <strong>two essential parsing tables</strong>: the <strong>Action Table</strong> and the <strong>Goto Table</strong>. These tables help the parser decide the appropriate action to take (shift, reduce, accept, or error) based on the current input and the state of the stack.</p>
    <p>The <strong>SLR parsing tables</strong> are constructed based on a given <strong>context-free grammar (CFG)</strong>. The goal is to create a parser that can analyze the syntax of a program by referencing these tables during the parsing process.</p>

    <h4>🧭 Steps for Constructing SLR Parsing Tables</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Augment the Grammar</strong>: The first step is to <strong>augment the grammar</strong> by adding a new start production to the grammar. This helps create a unique start symbol for the parse process.
            <p>For example, if the original grammar is:</p>
            <pre>E → E + T | T</pre>
            <p>The augmented grammar becomes:</p>
            <pre>S → E<br>E → E + T<br>E → T<br>T → id</pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Construct the Canonical Collection of LR(0) Items</strong>: <br> The <strong>LR(0) items</strong> represent a state of the parser where the parser has read up to a certain position in the production rules. The collection of <strong>LR(0) items</strong> is constructed by generating <strong>closures</strong> of each set of items.
            <p>Closure of a set of items: The closure operation adds all items that can be derived from the non-terminal being processed.</p>
            <p>Goto of a set of items: The goto operation represents the transition to another state after processing a specific input symbol.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Create the States</strong>: The parser will create <strong>states</strong> based on these <strong>LR(0) items</strong>. A <strong>state</strong> represents a configuration in the parsing process. We begin with the initial set of items (the closure of <strong>S' → .E</strong>) and continue by applying <strong>Goto</strong> on each item by reading the appropriate symbols (e.g., <strong>E</strong>, <strong>+</strong>, <strong>id</strong>).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Construct the Action Table</strong>: The <strong>Action Table</strong> defines the action (shift, reduce, accept, or error) for each combination of state and terminal symbol.
            <p><strong>Shift</strong>: If the current symbol is a terminal (like <strong>id</strong> or <strong>+</strong>), the parser will shift and move to a new state.</p>
            <p><strong>Reduce</strong>: If the current symbol matches the right-hand side of a production, the parser will reduce the production (i.e., replace the symbols with the corresponding non-terminal).</p>
            <p><strong>Accept</strong>: If the start symbol has been reduced and the input is consumed, the parsing process is accepted.</p>
            <p><strong>Error</strong>: If no valid action exists, an error is reported.</p>
            <p>The action table is filled by analyzing the items in each state. For each state, if it contains a production like <strong>A → α.</strong>, and the next symbol is <strong>b</strong>, then the action in the table will specify whether to shift or reduce.</p>
            <pre>Action Table Format:
                | State | id | +  | $  |
                | ----- | -- | -- | --- |
                | 0     | S3 |    |     |
                | 1     |    | S4 | Acc |
                | 2     | R2 | S5 |     |
                | 3     | R3 | R3 | R3  |</pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Construct the Goto Table</strong>: The <strong>Goto Table</strong> defines transitions between non-terminal symbols based on the current state.
            <p>If the current state contains a production <strong>A → α. B β</strong>, then <strong>Goto</strong> on <strong>B</strong> will move the parser to a new state based on the items obtained by the closure and the Goto operation.</p>
            <pre>Goto Table Format:
                | State | E | T |
                | ----- | - | - |
                | 0     | 1 | 2 |
                | 1     |   |   |
                | 2     |   |   |</pre>
        </li>

    <h4>📊 Example of Constructing an SLR Parsing Table</h4>
    <p>Consider the following simple grammar:</p>
    <pre>S → E<br>E → E + T<br>E → T<br>T → id</pre>

    <h5>Step 1: Augment the Grammar</h5>
    <pre>S' → E<br>E → E + T<br>E → T<br>T → id</pre>

    <h5>Step 2: Construct the Canonical Collection of LR(0) Items</h5>
    <p><strong>Initial set</strong> (I0):</p>
    <pre>S' → .E<br>E → .E + T<br>E → .T<br>T → .id</pre>
    <p><strong>Goto on E</strong> leads to <strong>I1</strong>:</p>
    <pre>S' → E.</pre>
    <p><strong>Goto on T</strong> leads to <strong>I2</strong>:</p>
    <pre>E → T.</pre>
    <p><strong>Goto on +</strong> leads to <strong>I3</strong>:</p>
    <pre>E → E + .T<br>T → .id</pre>

    <h5>Step 3: Construct the Action and Goto Tables</h5>
    <p><strong>Action Table</strong>:</p>
    <pre>| State | id | +  | $  |
    | ----- | -- | -- | --- |
    | 0     | S4 |    |     |
    | 1     |    | S3 | Acc |
    | 2     | R2 | S5 |     |
    | 3     | R3 | R3 | R3  |
    | 4     | R4 | R4 | R4  |
    | 5     | S4 |    |     |</pre>

    <p><strong>Goto Table</strong>:</p>
    <pre>| State | E | T |
    | ----- | - | - |
    | 0     | 1 | 2 |
    | 1     |   |   |
    | 2     |   |   |
    | 3     |   | 4 |
    | 4     |   |   |
    | 5     | 1 | 2 |</pre>

    <h4>✅ Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Constructing <strong>SLR parsing tables</strong> involves a sequence of steps starting with augmenting the grammar and proceeding through creating the <strong>LR(0) items</strong>, followed by the construction of the <strong>action</strong> and <strong>goto tables</strong>.
