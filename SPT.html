        <h3>Structure Preserving Transformations</h3>
        <p>    In compiler design, structure-preserving transformations refer to a category of optimizations that aim to improve the **efficiency** of the code while maintaining the **semantic structure** of the program. These transformations allow the compiler to rearrange or modify the program’s structure without changing its meaning or output. The primary objective is to optimize the program's performance (speed, memory usage, etc.) while ensuring that the transformed code preserves the original logic and execution behavior.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Characteristics of Structure Preserving Transformations</h4>
        <p><strong>1.Semantic Preservation:</strong>Structure-preserving transformations ensure that the transformed program produces the same output as the original program, even though the internal structure has changed. The meaning of the program remains the same, and no incorrect or unintended results are produced.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2.Focus on Efficiency:
        </strong>These transformations are mainly aimed at improving execution speed, reducing memory usage, or minimizing other computational resources, without altering the fundamental behavior of the program.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3.No Observable Side Effects:</strong>The transformations do not introduce any side effects that could change the program's observable behavior, such as modifying output values, introducing new variables, or altering control flow in unexpected ways.
    </p>

        <h4>Common Structure Preserving Transformations</h4>
        <h5>1.Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)
        </h5>
        <p><stong>Objective:</stong>Eliminate redundant calculations within the program by identifying subexpressions that are computed multiple times and reusing their results.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> If an expression is computed more than once within a basic block, the compiler can store the result of the expression in a temporary variable and reuse it instead of recalculating it every time.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>a = b + c<br>
        d = b + c<br><br>         The expression b + c is computed twice. The compiler can eliminate redundancy:
<br><br> temp = b + c<br>
a = temp<br>
d = temp
        </p>
        <h5>2.Loop Invariant Code Motion (LICM)</h5>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong>Move code that does not depend on the loop variable outside the loop to reduce redundant computations inside the loop.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The compiler identifies expressions in the loop that do not change with every iteration (invariant expressions), then moves them outside the loop to avoid recalculating them each time.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>for i = 1 to n:<br>
            x = a + b  // Invariant code<br>
            y = x + i<br><br>The calculation a + b does not depend on i and can be moved outside the loop:<br><br>

            x = a + b<br>
            for i = 1 to n:<br>
            y = x + i</p>
        <h5>3.Constant Folding and Propagation</h5>
        <p><strong>   Objective: </strong>Simplify constant expressions and propagate constant values throughout the program to optimize runtime performance.
        </p>
        <p><strong> How it works: </strong>The compiler evaluates expressions involving constant values at compile time rather than runtime and replaces the variables holding constant values with their actual values.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    
         
            x = 3 + 5  // Constant folding, evaluates to 8 at compile-time<br>
            y = x * 2  // Constant propagation, evaluates to 16
            </p>
        <h5>    4.Strength Reduction</h5>
        <p><strong>Objective: </strong>Replace expensive operations (such as multiplication or division) with simpler, faster operations (like addition or bit shifts).
        </p>
        <p><strong>  How it works: </strong>The compiler identifies opportunities to replace costly operations with cheaper alternatives that are equivalent in the context of the program.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    
        
            i = i * 8  // Expensive multiplication<br>
            i = i << 3  // Equivalent, cheaper bit shift</p>
    <h5>    5. Instruction Combining    </h5>
    <p><strong>   Objective:</strong>  Combine multiple adjacent instructions into a single instruction to reduce instruction count.
    </p>
    <p><strong>   How it works:</strong> The compiler identifies sequences of instructions that can be combined into a single instruction without changing the program's semantics.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    
         
        a = b + c<br>
        d = a + e<br><br>
        
   
        This can be combined into:<br><br>
   
        
        d = (b + c) + e</p>
    <h5>    5. Instruction Combining</h5>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong>  Combine multiple adjacent instructions into a single instruction to reduce instruction count.
    </p>
    <p><strong>  How it works: </strong>  The compiler identifies sequences of instructions that can be combined into a single instruction without changing the program's semantics.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    
         
        a = b + c<br>
        d = a + e<br><br>
        
   
        This can be combined into:<br><br>
   
        
        d = (b + c) + e</p>
        <h5>    6.Dead Code Elimination</h5>
        <p><strong>      Objective:</strong>  Remove code that has no effect on the program's output, thus reducing the code size and execution time.
        </p>
        <p><strong> How it works: </strong>The compiler identifies variables or expressions that are computed but never used, and removes them from the program.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    
         
            a = 10  // Dead code<br>
            b = 20<br><br>
           
       
            Here, 'a = 10' is dead code and can be removed.</p>
