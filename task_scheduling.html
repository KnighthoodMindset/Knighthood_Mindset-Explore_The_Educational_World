  <h3>Applications of Control Theory to Task Scheduling on a Cloud</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Control theory provides a mathematical and systematic approach for maintaining desired system behavior through feedback. In the context of cloud computing, where task scheduling involves allocating resources, managing loads, and meeting performance goals under variable conditions, control theory can be used to make scheduling adaptive, efficient, and self-correcting.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>1. Feedback-based Resource Allocation</h4>
  <p>Control systems continuously monitor CPU usage, memory, and network bandwidth and adjust resource allocations dynamically. For example, if a task starts consuming too much CPU, a control loop detects it and reallocates resources or shifts the task to another server.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>2. Auto-scaling of Resources</h4>
  <p>Using control theory, cloud systems can automatically scale the number of virtual machines up or down based on workload. PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers are often used to maintain response time or CPU utilization within desired thresholds.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>3. Load Balancing</h4>
  <p>Control strategies help balance tasks across servers by dynamically redirecting jobs to less-loaded nodes. This reduces latency, avoids bottlenecks, and ensures uniform resource utilization.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>4. Energy-efficient Scheduling</h4>
  <p>In large data centers, energy is a major concern. Control-theoretic methods can schedule tasks in a way that minimizes energy consumption by switching idle servers to low-power states or grouping tasks to fewer active machines.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>5. Latency Control</h4>
  <p>Control loops maintain task latency below a desired threshold by adjusting queue priorities, delaying low-priority tasks, or shifting tasks to faster servers when response time exceeds the limit.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>6. QoS-aware Scheduling</h4>
  <p>Quality of Service (QoS) is essential in cloud environments, especially for real-time applications. Control-based models ensure that each task meets QoS parameters such as deadline, throughput, or priority.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>7. Fault-tolerant Scheduling</h4>
  <p>If a task or VM fails, control systems can detect deviations in expected outputs and take corrective action by rescheduling tasks or reallocating resources in real-time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>8. Thermal-aware Scheduling</h4>
  <p>In physical servers, temperature must be managed to avoid hardware damage. Control systems can schedule tasks based on thermal feedback, reducing task loads on overheated machines and distributing them elsewhere.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>9. Bandwidth Management</h4>
  <p>Control theory helps regulate network bandwidth usage during task execution, avoiding congestion and ensuring fair sharing of network resources among all active tasks.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>10. Workflow Scheduling in Complex Systems</h4>
  <p>In systems involving dependent tasks like data pipelines, control models manage execution order, data flow, and timing to ensure tasks are scheduled optimally and completed on time.</p>
