### In-Vehicle Vision System ‚Äì A Detailed Overview

In-vehicle vision systems represent a rapidly evolving technology in the domain of intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. These systems use computer vision techniques to interpret visual data from cameras mounted in or around the vehicle, thereby enhancing safety, driving efficiency, and the overall driving experience. Let‚Äôs explore this topic comprehensively.

## üîç **1. Introduction**

An **in-vehicle vision system** is a set of integrated hardware and software components that enable real-time perception and understanding of the vehicle‚Äôs surroundings using digital imagery. This system typically includes:

* Cameras (monocular, stereo, 360¬∞ surround)
* Processing units (GPUs/CPUs/AI accelerators)
* Vision algorithms (object detection, lane detection, driver monitoring, etc.)

These systems are crucial for both **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** and **fully autonomous vehicles (AVs)**.
