        <h4>What is Artificail Intelligence</h4>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. Learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language comprehension are all examples of cognitive abilities.</p>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.</p>
        <p>AI refers to the creation of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as:</p>
        <li><strong>1. Learning:</strong> Acquiring knowledge and improving performance through experience.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Reasoning</strong> Drawing logical conclusions from available data.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Problem-Solving:</strong>Identifying and resolving complex problems.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Perception:</strong>Interpreting and understanding sensory data.</li>
